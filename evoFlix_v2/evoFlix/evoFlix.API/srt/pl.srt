1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,748
- Trusting this man is not a good idea.
- I can handle him.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,875
The TVA has pruned a lotta
these guys, and no two are alike.

3
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,164
You're all Variants!

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,758
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,554
They kidnapped you from the timeline.

6
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:20,456
The nexus event you caused,

7
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:23,081
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

8
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,664
Fine. You want the truth?

9
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,164
I'm trying to protect you.

10
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:28,664
Friendship like ours is uncommon.

11
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,664
You know where I'd go
if I could go anywhere?

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,706
Wherever it is I'm really from.

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,147
Yeah, wherever I had a life
before the TVA came along.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,335
Prune him.

15
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,873
The Time-Keepers took your lives from you.

16
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,623
You're Variants.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,625
We're the same.

18
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,541
Mindless androids.

19
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:49,456
Then who created the TVA?

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,958
Sylvie, I have to tell you something.

21
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,304
You're gonna tell me everything.

22
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:22,159
What is this place?
Where are we? Who are you?

23
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:25,335
This is The Void. That's Alioth.
And we're his lunch. Come on!

24
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:52,664
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
... <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> ...

25
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,879
Give me your TemPad.

26
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:58,586
Who's really behind the TVA?

27
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,857
I'm as in the dark as you are.

28
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,233
Poor Judge Renslayer. Your
whole reality's been destroyed.

29
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:10,206
Tell me, how does it feel to
be on the other side of it?

30
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,757
This is it, isn't it?

31
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:20,197
This is where you dragged
me after you stole my life.

32
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,603
A fitting place, then, to take yours.

33
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:25,541
And what if I said Loki wasn't dead?

34
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:27,408
Not yet, anyway.

35
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,951
- I'd say you were lying.
- Maybe.

36
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:33,452
- Or maybe we want the same thing.
- How is he still alive?

37
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:38,331
And how will saving him get us
closer to who's really behind the TVA?

38
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,164
It's complicated.

39
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,456
- I'm telling you this willingly.
- Why?

40
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,456
Because I wanna know
who's at the top of this.

41
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
I want to know who lied to me.

42
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,206
When we prune a branched reality,

43
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,539
it's impossible to
destroy all of its matter.

44
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,668
So we move it to a place on the timeline

45
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,804
where it won't continue growing.

46
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:00,748
Basically, the branched
timeline isn't reset.

47
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,831
- It's transferred.
- To where?

48
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,206
A void at the end of time.

49
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,831
Where every instance of existence
collides at the same point

50
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,578
and simply stops.

51
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:12,750
Why?

52
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,039
I don't know.

53
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:20,831
The dogma states that the end
of time is still being written,

54
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,914
that the Time-Keepers are
transforming it into utopia.

55
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,623
That's nice. Super believable.

56
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,083
Whatever the real reason...

57
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,746
nothing ever comes back from there.

58
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,333
I can help you if you trust me.

59
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,674
I suggest we take a breather, so I
can ask several thousand questions.

60
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,675
- Gotta keep moving so we don't die.
- Okay, but what's your plan?

61
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,623
- Don't die.
- Okay, but beyond that?

62
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,331
- Don't die.
- That's not a plan.

63
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,916
It's a general demand of living.

64
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,414
If you're Lokis, you
should always have...

65
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:19,023
Will someone please explain to
me what the hell is going on?

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,804
Look, it's been a very, very,
very trying past few days.

67
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:26,678
Months? I don't even know how
long it's been since New York.

68
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:29,080
All I know is, I got
pruned and I woke up here,

69
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,234
and now I'm surrounded by Variants
of myself, plus an alligator,

70
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:36,125
which sadly I didn't
find all that strange.

71
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,984
And now we're running from God
knows what to God knows where.

72
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:42,318
When I need to be trying to
find a way back to the TVA.

73
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,773
Stop wailing or you will signal Alioth.

74
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,958
You mean the monster in the sky?

75
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,789
Thank you.

76
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,956
This is the place where
the TVA dumps its rubbish,

77
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,039
everything they prune.

78
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,333
And Alioth,

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,248
he ensures none of it ever returns.

80
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,248
It's a living tempest that
consumes matter and energy.

81
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,956
They send entire branched realities
here that are devoured instant...

82
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,164
We're in a shark tank.
Alioth is the shark.

83
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,664
Oh, there's no such thing
as an alligator tank.

84
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,207
Besides, it's a better metaphor.

85
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,998
He's overly sensitive
like the rest of us.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,206
Hang on,

87
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,541
- that thing's a Loki too?
- Oh, yes.

88
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:33,651
Okay, fine. Willing to accept
that. Why are there so many of you?

89
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,955
Because Lokis survive.
That's just what we do.

90
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,831
- Great. So how do we escape?
- We don't.

91
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,507
All of us were arrested by the
TVA and pruned, just like you.

92
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,417
And just like you, we all stood around

93
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,175
making bad plans that went nowhere.

94
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,748
But we could use a TemPad.

95
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,248
Oh, the one thing that could
get us out of here, yes.

96
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,456
They're all over the place, right, guys?

97
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,414
Fine. What about causing a nexus event?

98
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,623
The TVA doesn't care what happens here.

99
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,456
- Surely there's something to do.
- There is.

100
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,039
Survive. That's all there
is. All there ever was.

101
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,703
We're done talking. Let's go.

102
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,083
Just do what you want.

103
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,686
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

104
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,956
Why do you wear the horns?
You let a child command you.

105
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,958
You'll do well to respect the boy.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,498
- This is his kingdom.
- Right.

107
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,498
What was your nexus event, Your Majesty?

108
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,708
I killed Thor.

109
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,791
So, why did you want to return
to the TVA so badly, anyway?

110
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,333
You leave your glorious purpose there?

111
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,666
Something like that.

112
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,039
Miss Minutes, I need
you to remote access

113
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,498
a series of restricted
files from the archives.

114
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,210
Ooh, doggy! On what?

115
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:46,062
The beginning of time.
The founding of the TVA.

116
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,708
- Right away.
- Wait.

117
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,273
- What about the end of time?
- It's just a void.

118
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,609
What if The Void isn't the end?
What if there's something beyond it?

119
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,664
Hiding in the shadow of
apocalypses obscured me from the TVA

120
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,708
because I couldn't create a
diverging branch there, right?

121
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:13,953
So if all of this is
still being written,

122
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,413
whatever happens is just a new timeline.

123
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,831
It would be impossible to
start a nexus event there.

124
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,781
- You could be completely undetectable.
- That's it.

125
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,574
That's the only place they could be.

126
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,322
So how do we get past The Void?

127
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,359
It's impossible.

128
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:31,664
There's nothing for the TemPad
to lock onto, no destination.

129
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,875
Then we go through it.

130
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,831
- That's suicide.
- Then I guess my need for you has passed.

131
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,539
Wait. What about The Void spacecraft?

132
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,664
Yes, the prototype.

133
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,708
Great. I'll get the file.

134
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:50,434
It's a spaceship designed to
withstand the temporal void.

135
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,664
It could take us to the end of time.

136
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,831
- Find Loki.
- Find the man behind the curtain.

137
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,416
- And kill him.
- Together.

138
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,914
Miss Minutes, where are
the files on this timecraft?

139
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
Still lookin', hon.

140
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:10,367
Nothing?

141
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,773
Hmm. Buried pretty deep.

142
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,812
It's highly restricted. I
might not even have clearance.

143
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,083
Oh, no, I think you would. If it's real.

144
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,466
How long?

145
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:21,781
Any second now.

146
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,657
Go! Go! Go! Move it!

147
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,748
- You hurt?
- I'm fine, but she took my TemPad.

148
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,664
Sylvie? Not thinking of
going on the run, are you?

149
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,000
We know where you hide.

150
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,000
Sooner or later, we'll catch you.

151
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,000
It must be so exhausting.

152
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:46,043
I'll admit you had me
fooled there for a minute.

153
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,873
Or did you get a little real?

154
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,914
Did Judge Renslayer really feel
betrayed by her beloved TVA?

155
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,998
Why don't you come back out
and we can talk about it?

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,394
Sure. Just tell
everyone else to piss off

157
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:03,789
and we can settle this between us.

158
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,289
Works for me.

159
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,539
What happened to finding
the man behind the curtain?

160
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,373
Tell you what. You come
out with your hands up

161
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,081
and I'll put you in a time loop.

162
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,367
Something not so bad.

163
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,750
You can live out your
days in a good memory.

164
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,875
Do you have any good memories?

165
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,333
Just one, really.

166
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,541
- She self-pruned.
- Good.

167
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,166
Then she's dead, too.

168
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:03,206
So, after I vanquished
Captain America and Iron Man,

169
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:08,039
I claimed my prize,
all six Infinity Stones.

170
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:14,039
That's alligator for growling and
saying "liar" at the same time.

171
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,539
At least my nexus event wasn't
eating the wrong neighbor's cat.

172
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hey, hey, hey.

173
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:34,164
- Tell them your story, Loki.
- Me?

174
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,373
Nobody wants to hear about that.

175
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,695
I would, actually.

176
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:40,112
Um...

177
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,000
It's just I've been
wondering, because I'm...

178
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,789
Well, we're supposed to die, right?

179
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,031
Thanos kills us after Ragnarok.

180
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,333
Thanos?

181
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,125
In my timeline,

182
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,248
everything proceeded
correctly, my entire life,

183
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,539
until Thanos attacked our ship.

184
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,289
So, you didn't try to stab him?

185
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,831
Certainly not.

186
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,706
Take no offense, my friends,

187
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,289
but blades are worthless in
the face of a Loki sorcery.

188
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,956
They stunt our magical potential.

189
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,539
- But they look awesome.
- Oh, yes.

190
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,624
Especially when they
clatter to the ground

191
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,825
just before your neck is snapped.

192
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:28,373
I cast a projection of myself so
real, even the Mad Titan believed it.

193
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,961
Then hid as inanimate debris.

194
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:35,208
After I faked my death,
I simply drifted in space.

195
00:14:36,105 --> 00:14:38,895
Away from Thor, away from everything.

196
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:41,354
Thought about the universe
and my place in it,

197
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:44,147
and it occurred to me
that everywhere I went,

198
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,189
only pain followed.

199
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:49,357
So I removed myself from the equation,

200
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,275
landed on a remote planet and stayed
there in isolation, in solitude

201
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:57,750
for a long, long time.

202
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:04,820
How did the TVA find you?

203
00:15:04,823 --> 00:15:06,041
I got lonely.

204
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,873
To tell you the truth,
I missed my brother,

205
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,706
and I wondered if he missed
me, if anybody else did.

206
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,914
But as soon as I took my first
steps to getting off the planet,

207
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,081
the TVA arrived.

208
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,581
Because we, my friends,
have but one part to play,

209
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,208
the God of Outcasts.

210
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,876
Nothing more.

211
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,750
The God of Outcasts.

212
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,498
- I'm going.
- Going where?

213
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,860
Out of this place, out of
The Void, back to the TVA.

214
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,289
We're as good at escaping
as we are at surviving.

215
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,883
That gives me a decent chance.

216
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:54,123
- You won't do either, you'll be murdered.
- Well, so be it.

217
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:57,422
- That was my destiny to begin with.
- You're different.

218
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,542
- Why?
- No, I'm not, you see?

219
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:03,747
I'm the same, really. I'm
the same as all of you.

220
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,664
Have any of you met
a woman Variant of us?

221
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,914
- Sounds terrifying.
- Oh, she is.

222
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,123
But that's kind of
what's great about her.

223
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,498
She's different.

224
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,774
She's not trying to take over the
TVA, she's trying to take it down.

225
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:18,733
And she needs me.

226
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:22,453
Now, you said Alioth
is what keeps us here.

227
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,443
You said it's a living
thing. You said it's a shark.

228
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:29,821
Well, if it lives, it dies.

229
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:31,489
So I'm gonna kill the shark.

230
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:35,391
I'm gonna kill Alioth, and I
could use all the help I can get.

231
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,498
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

232
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,623
- Monsters.
- Oh, yeah.

233
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:13,688
Ah. Hello, which one of us are you?

234
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,708
This is a nightmare.

235
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,081
You.

236
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,498
Shut the door, we still
got a situation here.

237
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,907
You should be careful just jumping
into a stranger's car like that.

238
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,368
- Watch out!
- I see it, I see it.

239
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:54,362
Really? You're driving right towards it.

240
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,413
God, you really are one of you.

241
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,547
Hang on.

242
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,539
You bastard! You led
the wolves to our door.

243
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,914
We prefer snakes to wolves.

244
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,914
I've eaten both. They die just the same.

245
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,789
Apologies, my liege.

246
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,375
I betrayed you, and now, I'm king.

247
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,748
About that...

248
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,664
- You can't be serious.
- Come on.

249
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,039
- What did you expect?
- That was not the bargain!

250
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,414
I gave you our location. In
exchange for shelter and supplies,

251
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,748
you give me your army
and I take the throne.

252
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,039
Ah, yes.

253
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,141
Not so good a bargain.

254
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:44,123
How about this one? My army, my throne?

255
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,416
About that.

256
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,789
Why you beef-witted, half-faced scrubs.

257
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,914
- We had a deal!
- For God's sake.

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,998
Why the hell is there
an alligator in here?

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,456
He's a Loki!

260
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,833
Glorious purpose!

261
00:20:37,024 --> 00:20:38,166
Come on.

262
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,583
Take that, Loki!

263
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,456
Damn it! Animals, animals!

264
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,831
We lie and we cheat,

265
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,998
we cut the throat of every person
who trusts us, and for what?

266
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,291
Power. Glorious power. Glorious purpose!

267
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:10,154
We cannot change.

268
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:14,613
We're broken, every
version of us. Forever.

269
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:17,581
And whenever one of us
dares try to fix themselves,

270
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,248
they're sent here to die.

271
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,498
That's why I need to get out of here.

272
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,998
Nothing can change
until the TVA is stopped.

273
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,706
- And you trust her?
- She's the only one I do trust.

274
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:32,789
And right now, I believe she's our
only chance of stopping the TVA.

275
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,208
That's good enough for me.

276
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,939
Okay, okay. We'll help you.

277
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:44,541
But approaching Alioth
is a death sentence.

278
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,196
We'll get you to it, but
that's as far as we go.

279
00:21:56,333 --> 00:22:00,123
All that time, I really
believed we were the good guys.

280
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:03,664
Annihilating entire realities,
orphaning little girls,

281
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,352
classic hero stuff.

282
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:08,498
Well, I guess when you think
the ends justify the means,

283
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,123
there's not much you won't do.

284
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,664
By the way, you did
some annihilating too.

285
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,664
- I did what I had to do.
- Yeah, so did I.

286
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,399
You hunted me like a dog.

287
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,541
I'm sorry about that.

288
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,340
When I pruned myself, I thought
I might be able to find Loki.

289
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,789
That storm, that thing,
it's likely already got him.

290
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,289
You really believe that?

291
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,541
It doesn't matter.

292
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,331
The only thing that matters
now is getting out of here

293
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,498
and finding out who's
behind all of this.

294
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,039
Great. How do we do that?

295
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,208
We turn around.

296
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,831
Turn around? What, and go
back to the angry cloud?

297
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,373
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

298
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,750
We're going back to it.

299
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,957
I have to say,

300
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:13,469
it feels odd walking toward
the gargantuan creature.

301
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,455
Do you have a plan of action?

302
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,414
Get inside, find its
heart or brain or whatever,

303
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,498
- and then, you know, do it in.
- I mean...

304
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,375
Just because it's not
complicated doesn't mean it's bad.

305
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,664
It also doesn't mean it's good.

306
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,914
See? He's on board.

307
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,041
He's praying. He thinks
we're going to die.

308
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,500
All hands to battle stations!

309
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,706
Alioth is like any animal.

310
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,750
He'll go after the big meal first.

311
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,748
And while he's busy with that, we
can sneak around the back and...

312
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,916
Fire!

313
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,844
Okay.

314
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,555
Maybe we, uh...

315
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,416
think a bit more about this, huh?

316
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:35,213
Car.

317
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:37,086
- What?
- Along the horizon.

318
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,289
Is that bad?

319
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,914
Well, usually means
cannibalistic marauders

320
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,498
or cannibalistic pirates.

321
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,750
Delightful.

322
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,039
Now they're slowing down.

323
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,291
- What are they doing?
- Just stay on guard.

324
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:55,969
Sylvie.

325
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,123
I don't understand. Is he a
coward or was he being brave?

326
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,125
- I'm not too sure.
- Come on.

327
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,248
You're alive.

328
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,916
What happened? You okay?

329
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,333
Mobius!

330
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,659
How did you...

331
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,661
We thought you could
do with some backup.

332
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,497
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait,
these are my friends.

333
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,123
Well, they're, um...
How best to put this?

334
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,373
Us as a child, us in the future,

335
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:37,219
and us as an alligator.

336
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,399
It's best not to question it.

337
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:42,706
You throw a rock out
here, you hit a Loki.

338
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,383
So you're all after the giant
cloud monster, too, then?

339
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:48,553
Well, we haven't decided how
we're going to kill it, but...

340
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:51,747
- Come again? Kill it?
- Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

341
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,456
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

342
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,289
- Yeah.
- And you went along with it?

343
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,081
- I had my doubts.
- Probably unsafe.

344
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,498
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

345
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,369
I think the person we're after is
beyond The Void at the end of time.

346
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:04,453
And if they are,

347
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:07,871
that thing is just their guard
dog protecting the only way in.

348
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:11,366
Okay, so, um, how do we
get past the guard dog?

349
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,206
I'm gonna enchant it.

350
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,150
- That's insane, right?
- As insane as what?

351
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:20,164
- Paper-cutting a cloud to death?
- Listen,

352
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,583
- I've been down here longer than you...
- I'm going to enchant it.

353
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,833
She's pretty confident.

354
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,361
Leave us.

355
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,666
Why am I locked in here?

356
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:14,367
You freed the Variant.

357
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,785
- You were disloyal to the TVA.
- Disloyal?

358
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:21,291
- Did you think you'd escape punishment?
- Disloyal to who?

359
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,831
You were in the Time-Keepers'
chambers. They weren't real.

360
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,498
And why does that change anything?

361
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,501
That changes everything!

362
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:31,413
The people need to know the truth.

363
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,414
No, the TVA needs stability.

364
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,353
And until we figure out what's
going on, that is what it will get.

365
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,500
So you need to tell me everything.

366
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,125
What exactly do you want from me?

367
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,039
You had a link with the Variant.

368
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,081
I want you to tell me what drives her.

369
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,791
Revenge drives her.

370
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,831
Killing the Time-Keepers.

371
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:01,623
But they turned out to be
fake, in case you forgot.

372
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,291
So she'll be searching
for whomever created them.

373
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,791
This isn't about protecting
the TVA at all, is it?

374
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,166
You just want to find whoever
is behind all of this, too.

375
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,331
You'll never find them.

376
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,072
Not before she does.

377
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,291
And why is that?

378
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,375
You only want it.

379
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,166
She needs it.

380
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,164
Hey, y'all.

381
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,414
I need all the files on
the founding of the TVA.

382
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,373
Everything from the beginning of time.

383
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,164
Well, that's a mighty tall order.

384
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,689
Whoever created this place is in danger.

385
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,315
I need to find them.

386
00:29:05,318 --> 00:29:07,525
Okay. Right away, ma'am.

387
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:22,831
You really don't remember him?

388
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,166
I mean, the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

389
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:28,798
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

390
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,166
I mean, who's to say
he's even a Loki Variant?

391
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,581
He is green, isn't he?

392
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,123
I don't know, he could be lying.

393
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:40,373
The long con. Of course, that just
makes him more likely to be a Loki.

394
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:44,375
It's always the game within the
game with you guys, which I respect.

395
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,873
Mobius,

396
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,791
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

397
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:54,041
what exactly are you
getting yourself into?

398
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,337
I don't know.

399
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,997
I'd like to let people know the truth.

400
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,041
So just like that, you're
turning on the very thing

401
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,331
you devoted your life to.

402
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,333
Well, it's never too late to change.

403
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,166
I hope they know what they're doing.

404
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,458
Mobius isn't so bad.

405
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,267
Or so good.

406
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,208
I think that's why we get along.

407
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:29,916
He cares about you.

408
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,125
- It's cold.
- Mmm-hmm.

409
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,541
I could conjure one
for you, if you like.

410
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,248
You could conjure me a new outfit.

411
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,072
You have no idea how uncomfortable
something like this is.

412
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,984
So...

413
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:17,205
Mobius and his theory about...

414
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,373
Right, right. About our nexus event.

415
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,123
- Total rubbish, right?
- Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

416
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,289
I don't mean that it
wasn't a nice moment.

417
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,331
No, it was great. It was really nice.

418
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,539
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

419
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:32,720
A hundred percent. I
mean, totally. Yeah.

420
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,873
I don't know how to do this.

421
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,689
I don't even know what we're doing.

422
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,289
I don't have friends.

423
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,166
I don't have...

424
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,859
anyone.

425
00:31:57,862 --> 00:31:59,527
Well...

426
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,070
there are more important things, right?

427
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:05,456
Right? Yeah. Like bringing down the TVA.

428
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,081
Saving the universe, even.

429
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,884
Well, there's no need to be
dramatic, but, yeah, kind of.

430
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,048
It's not very snuggly.

431
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:32,206
- Okay.
- Is it a tablecloth?

432
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,958
No, it's a blanket.

433
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,666
Thank you.

434
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,416
My pleasure.

435
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,791
How do I know that, in the final
moments, you won't betray me?

436
00:32:59,794 --> 00:33:01,205
Listen, Sylvie, I...

437
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:07,728
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

438
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,041
I betrayed my father, my brother...

439
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,416
my home.

440
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:16,666
I know what I did.

441
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,750
And I know why I did it.

442
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,250
And that's not who I am anymore.

443
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:27,833
Okay?

444
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,333
I won't let you down.

445
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:33,500
You sure?

446
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:38,626
'Cause if we make it,
and the TVA is gone,

447
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,789
there might be a
timeline for you to rule.

448
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,289
Ah.

449
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,708
And then I'd finally be happy.

450
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,500
What about you?

451
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,791
What will you do when this is all over?

452
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,500
I don't know.

453
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,291
I don't know either.

454
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:10,250
Maybe...

455
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:15,416
Maybe we could figure it out...

456
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:18,666
together.

457
00:34:20,986 --> 00:34:22,250
Maybe.

458
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,539
Okay, so what's the next move?

459
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,539
The TVA needs to be brought down.

460
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,831
We don't know who created
it or where they are,

461
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,498
but that thing out there does.

462
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,206
When it hit me earlier, I linked to it.

463
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,373
It was brief, but I caught
a glimpse of something,

464
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,539
and I think if I can get close
enough to it, I can enchant it,

465
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,416
and it's gonna take me to
whoever's behind all of this.

466
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:35,875
I'm staying.

467
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:43,907
- Loki, I don't know if this is gonna work.
- You go, I go.

468
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,039
It's happening, guys. The
branch will be right out there.

469
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,956
I'll give your regards to Renslayer.

470
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,289
Oh, please do.

471
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,123
You boys want a ticket out of here?

472
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,706
What? No. We're staying here.

473
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,789
This is our home.

474
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:06,456
Are you sure? What about Alioth?

475
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,789
We've survived this long.
We know what we're doing.

476
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,539
Loki, you're gonna need
this on your journey.

477
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:13,666
Go on.

478
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:33,539
Good luck.

479
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,697
I hope you find what you're looking for.

480
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,306
Looks like you got away in the end.

481
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,083
I always do.

482
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,000
What will you do at the TVA?

483
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,375
Burn it to the ground.

484
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,000
Thanks for the spark.

485
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,883
Well, see you later, Loki.

486
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:20,821
Thank you, my friend.

487
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,166
You're my favorite.

488
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,422
When a branch appears,
Alioth will focus on it.

489
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:51,706
That's when I'll enchant it.

490
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,289
What if we don't have
time to wait for a branch?

491
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,208
We'll have to cause a distraction.

492
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,750
Come and get me!

493
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:42,964
No! This way!

494
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,509
Come and get me!

495
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:48,666
No! No!

496
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,916
How is he doing that?

497
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:23,422
I think we're stronger than we realize.

498
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:34,003
Go!

499
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,123
What are you doing?

500
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,961
We're gonna enchant it.

501
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:49,754
I don't know how.

502
00:40:49,757 --> 00:40:51,080
You do.

503
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:52,735
Because we're the same!

504
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,529
Glorious purpose!

505
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:57,099
Open your eyes.
