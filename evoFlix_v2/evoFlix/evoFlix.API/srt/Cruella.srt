1
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,835
Oh, no.
We're starting here? Okay.

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,171
From the very beginning
I've always made a statement.

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,010
Not everyone appreciated that.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,804
That's unfortunate.

5
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,722
But I wasn't for everyone.

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,642
Speaking of statements, here's one.

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,645
That necklace is the reason I'm dead.

8
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,772
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

9
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,816
From an early age,
I realized I saw the world

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,043
differently than everyone else.

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,110
Look!

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,337
Well, that's not the pattern.

13
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,588
You have to follow the pattern.

14
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,812
There's a way of doing things.

15
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,591
- That's ugly.
- Including my mother.

16
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,825
That's cruel.

17
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,827
Your name's Estella, not Cruella.

18
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,417
It wasn't her I was challenging,

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,877
it was the world.

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,715
But of course my mother knew that.

21
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,966
That's what worried her.

22
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,343
Remember, you belong here
as much as anyone.

23
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,636
They're lucky to have you.

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,054
Agreed.

25
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,391
Hey. What do you say to Cruella
when she tries to get the better of you?

26
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,894
Thank you for coming, but you may go now.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
Good. Now say goodbye to her.

28
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,022
Goodbye, Cruella.

29
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,523
And wear the hat.

30
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,609
I don't need the hat.

31
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,654
Well, be polite. And good.

32
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,656
And friendly.

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,618
How does the saying go?

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,162
"I am woman. Hear me roar."

35
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,581
Well, that wasn't much
of a thing back in 1964,

36
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,374
but it was about to be.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,460
Hi, my name's Estella.

38
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,713
Look. A skunk's got loose in the building.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,216
Nice jacket.

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,384
Hi, I'm Anita.

41
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,761
Estella.

42
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,012
Ignore them.

43
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,473
Just did. But it might not last.

44
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,518
"Ignore them"?

45
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,521
Didn't I just say, "Hear me roar"?

46
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,287
Fight! Fight! Fight!

47
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,948
That didn't sit well
with some people.

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,405
This is a blot on your copybook.

49
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,842
Okay, that didn't
sit well with a lot of people.

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,160
Enough.

51
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,870
She deserved it!

52
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,540
But I found friends
in unlikely places.

53
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,208
Hello.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,836
Like this guy.

55
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,171
There's a dog?

56
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,382
Buddy. I found him.

57
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,176
And not this guy.

58
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,681
Her. Anita Darling.
What a fabulous name.

59
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,149
You could say
I pretty much roared my way

60
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,318
through all of primary school.

61
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,780
Almost.

62
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,954
Well, I think it's clear what happens now.

63
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,956
Estella, you are expelled...

64
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,083
I'm withdrawing her from your school.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,501
I'm expelling her.

66
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,396
It's too late because
I withdrew her first,

67
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,880
so that can't be on her record.

68
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,465
I'd said expelled. I'd already said it.

69
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,176
Hadn't.

70
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,260
Didn't.

71
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,680
And might I say, your school
seems to turn out horrible children

72
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,016
with no creativity or compassion.

73
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,392
Or genius.

74
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,521
You're out.

75
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,064
Out!

76
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,234
Being a genius is one thing.

77
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,779
Raising a genius, however,
does come with its challenges.

78
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,365
London, here we come!

79
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,284
Well, we don't really have a choice.

80
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,580
You have no school.
It's nothing to celebrate.

81
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,669
Well...

82
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,340
Can't be a fashion designer
in a small town anyway.

83
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,514
Can we go here?

84
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,519
Regent's Park? Perfect.

85
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,980
When we get to the city,
first thing we'll do,

86
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,525
we'll go to the fountain,
and we'll have a cup of tea

87
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,968
and we'll start planning
how to make this London thing work.

88
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,698
Why are you in your best dress?

89
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,626
I need to make a stop
on our way to the city.

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,941
Just ask a friend for a little help
to get us on our feet.

91
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,080
What friend?

92
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,625
Well, a friend because
of the situation that we're in.

93
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,507
I'll be less trouble from now on, Mum.

94
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,884
I promise.

95
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,654
I meant it when I said it.

96
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,827
When a girl like me
makes a promise like that,

97
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,663
you don't take her to a place like this.

98
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,434
What is this place?

99
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,651
Wear it. It looks good.

100
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,198
Looks better without, I think.
Be yours one day.

101
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,449
It's a family heirloom.

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,660
- Will you mind it for me?
- Really?

103
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,498
Come on, Buddy.

104
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,583
Uh, Estella.

105
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,126
Serious voice.

106
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,420
Stay in the car. I won't be long.

107
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,130
Mum!

108
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,840
I need you to lie low.

109
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,675
Lie low while wearing a hat?

110
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,054
Exactly. Love you.

111
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,222
Love you more.

112
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,402
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

113
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,196
I did try to lay low.

114
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,201
Is that fur and chiffon?
In the one gown?

115
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:52,663
But as you can see, I broke the promise.

116
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,207
Just a little.

117
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,294
I am. I'm sure
it'll be quite extravagant.

118
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,794
It usually is, isn't it?

119
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,129
Go to the east garden.
I'll see what I can do.

120
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,774
I figured while Mum was busy

121
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,675
seeing her mysterious friend,

122
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,677
I'd just take a little peek.

123
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,984
The problem was,

124
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,279
that little peek pretty much blew my mind.

125
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,366
I had no idea where I was or what it was.

126
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,120
I just knew that
for the first time in my life,

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,205
I felt like I belonged.

128
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,378
Buddy, unfortunately, did not.

129
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,005
Buddy! No!

130
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,306
Got ya.

131
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,729
Keep the hat on, before anyone sees that.

132
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,286
I could've blamed Buddy
for what happened next.

133
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,374
I just need a little help,
just to get us on our feet.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,920
But the truth is,
I did escalate things.

135
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,330
Oh, my goodness!

136
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,410
Oh, crumbs!

137
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,080
And I will keep my mouth shut,

138
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,873
and I will never come back here.

139
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,169
- Mum!
- She's my life.

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,028
No!

141
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,245
There are no words.

142
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,372
There's been
the most dreadful accident.

143
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,498
It was my fault.

144
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,145
Police Commissioner Weston!

145
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,710
A woman...

146
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,920
She was threatening me,
demanding money. I...

147
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,256
I had killed my mother.

148
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,216
I think they were chasing someone.

149
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,426
Search the grounds!

150
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,736
And in that moment...

151
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,095
Search the grounds!

152
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,848
...the best I could think to do

153
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,143
was run.

154
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,878
And I ran for a long time.

155
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,296
I made it to London after all.

156
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,883
Regent's Park.

157
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,052
But no tea.

158
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,899
It's all my fault, Buddy.

159
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,138
No Mum.

160
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,142
I never should've gone in.

161
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,229
I was an orphan.

162
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,028
My necklace.

163
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,033
Sad story.

164
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,581
Genius girl turns into stupid girl
who gets her mother killed

165
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,667
and ends up alone.

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,091
But a new day brings new opportunities

167
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:59,178
or at least a couple of
petty thieves. Horace...

168
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,305
Sir, please could you
spare some change?

169
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,389
No, sorry.

170
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,849
...and Jasper.

171
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,564
Morning.

172
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,735
Stay back!

173
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,570
Horace was generally annoying.

174
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,530
Ow!

175
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,116
Go back to your family, little girl!

176
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,452
Jasper was the insightful one.

177
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,703
She has no family.

178
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,190
Which was also annoying.

179
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,207
And Wink was just plain friendly.

180
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
Again, annoying.

181
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,960
Buddy!

182
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,172
- Oi!
- Come on, Horace.

183
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,341
But they were a better option
than being in jail.

184
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,467
Stop!

185
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,843
Police!

186
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,099
Oi, you little scallywags!

187
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:40,904
That was close.

188
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,656
I think we lost her.

189
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,283
Ya think?

190
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,582
Where are we?

191
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,792
So, what's your story?

192
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,795
Where are your parents?

193
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,930
My mum's dead.

194
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,267
I skipped over the part
where I killed her.

195
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,230
I think you should stay here,
be a part of our gang.

196
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,816
She should what?
What, what, what?

197
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,109
This has not been discussed.

198
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,486
It's being discussed now.
And we could use a girl

199
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,531
to look innocent and be a distraction.

200
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,122
I wanted to be a fashion designer,

201
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,624
not a thief.

202
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,376
You don't got that many options.
Just us.

203
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,795
He was right. I was a fugitive.

204
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,756
Is she crying again?

205
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,760
Her mum died.
You remember what that's like.

206
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:49,014
And there was one thing
I knew they'd be looking for.

207
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,016
Cripes!

208
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,020
I need to dye my hair.

209
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,524
I don't know, I quite like it.

210
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:06,198
Granted, being a thief
is not exactly a mother's dream,

211
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,576
but she was gone.

212
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,043
Don't worry, we're just getting started.

213
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,604
There's lots more bad things coming...

214
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,712
I promise.

215
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,856
Let's go, Buddy.

216
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,194
We're on!

217
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,072
Before I knew it, ten years had passed.

218
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,700
You could even say
we had made a home for ourselves.

219
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,243
Horace! Heads-up!

220
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,079
Two minutes! It's stoppage time.

221
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,473
We were like a family.

222
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,416
Horace, let's go!

223
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,877
- A family that's good at...
- Get dressed!

224
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,420
...stealing stuff.

225
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,130
I'm frightfully sorry.

226
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,813
Do you know if Piccadilly is the next...

227
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,133
Really,

228
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,719
really,

229
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,263
really good.

230
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,640
Oh, this is me.

231
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,078
We expanded our business.

232
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,800
I designed fabulous disguises.

233
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,178
We'd steal.

234
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,306
There you go, madam.

235
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,811
I'd design.

236
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,777
We'd steal.

237
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,112
Not your dog!
We are not coming back here!

238
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:12,616
Design.

239
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,957
It was a beautiful operation.

240
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,254
I got to do what I love,

241
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,382
and we were reaping the rewards.

242
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,263
But as good as things were,
I felt I was meant for more in this life.

243
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,557
That my mum would've wanted more for me.

244
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,475
I just didn't know what.

245
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,063
Hey! Psst!

246
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,885
What are you doing?

247
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,490
Just bored.

248
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,534
Bored? Are you kidding?

249
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,411
I found a tiny TV.

250
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,122
Japanese fellow asleep on the bed.

251
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,502
Uh, excuse me, who are you three?

252
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,670
Run.

253
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,257
Good Lord!

254
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,675
Oi! Thieves!

255
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,152
Two, three!

256
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,235
Happy birthday to you!

257
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,365
Happy birthday to you!

258
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,994
Happy birthday, dear Estell-la-la-la-la!

259
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,121
Happy birthday to you!

260
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,706
And me and Jasper

261
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,666
And Wink and Buddy

262
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,753
This is the nicest birthday in...

263
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,631
In a while.

264
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,132
Not for Judy.

265
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,675
- Who's Judy?
- It doesn't matter.

266
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,511
It is no big deal. She just...

267
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,720
Oh, Judy.

268
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:57,846
...might be hungry.

269
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:04,811
- Make a wish.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks, Judy.

270
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,274
What's this?

271
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,194
This is an offer of employment
from Liberty of London.

272
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,737
Entry-level position.

273
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,949
Oh, I hope it's a burger place, right?

274
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,452
No, it's the most fashionable
department store in the city.

275
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,246
How did you do this?

276
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,373
Pulled a couple of strings.

277
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,878
I love Liberty!

278
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,090
Yeah, I know you do.
I see you look at it every time we pass.

279
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,937
Now, I might have padded out
your CV a bit.

280
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,110
As in, completely. Invented it.

281
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,135
We've all done it.

282
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,363
Yeah, we've all done it.
Everyone does it.

283
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,721
Invented a few references.

284
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,266
If they ask you
how you know Prince Charles,

285
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,893
you just say it's a polo thing.

286
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,144
Right.

287
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,396
Happy birthday.

288
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,564
"Polo thing."

289
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,693
So, what is the angle?

290
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,821
There is no angle,
other than Estella living her dream.

291
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,739
- Right. Okay.
- Yeah.

292
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,300
What is it really?
What's the angle?

293
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,285
No, there is...
All right, I'll tell you what,

294
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,581
the angle is that
Estella is way too talented

295
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,627
to be doing grifts
with the likes of me and you.

296
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,418
Thanks, Jasper.

297
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,586
It's all right.

298
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,677
Mum, I got my chance.
The one I always wanted.

299
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,764
Trust me, I'm going to keep
my head down and make it.

300
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,434
Cheers.

301
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,903
Liberty of London.

302
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,326
It was the pinnacle of fashion
in the '70s.

303
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,245
They carried all the best designers.

304
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,416
And now I worked there.

305
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,934
Now, you mentioned the scarf as well.

306
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,462
On Tuesday?

307
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,597
I have it right in front of me here.

308
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,975
I told him to be very specific
about what I wrote.

309
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,273
Ah, excuse me, sir.

310
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,149
I had a thought about the front window...

311
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,443
I gave you your job description.

312
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,030
Don't go outside the boundaries
of your engagement. Please.

313
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,786
Not now.

314
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,331
- Ah! Sir...
- Not now.

315
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,626
No, no, no.

316
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,019
Not now.

317
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,572
Ah!

318
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,621
Sir, I just wanted to say,
I really am a dab hand with a needle

319
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,147
if Alterations could use anything.

320
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,875
Why are you talking and not cleaning?

321
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,920
Did you do all the bathrooms
according to the regulations I gave you?

322
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,714
- Soap, water, mop, bleach, polish?
- I did.

323
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,924
- In that order?
- Yes.

324
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,550
But Alterations, you wouldn't...

325
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,095
regret it.

326
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,310
- Hey.
- Hey!

327
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,728
Hi.

328
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,730
You forgot your lunch.

329
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,441
Thank you.

330
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,405
No.

331
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,490
What?

332
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,576
I'm not letting you in that window,
so you can try and crack the safe.

333
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,832
- That's not the angle?
- No. There is no angle.

334
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,956
There's no angle.

335
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,000
What do you mean, there's no angle?
Come on, Wink!

336
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,171
There's no angle.

337
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,297
Horace.

338
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,675
Thanks for lunch. Bye, Wink.

339
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,728
Really?

340
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:04,862
Perfect.

341
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,504
I feel sad that you think that looks good.

342
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,589
What?

343
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,049
I feel sad you think
that looks good.

344
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:35,934
Afternoon.

345
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,644
Lovely hat.

346
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,479
Whatever covers your neck more.

347
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,117
You have...

348
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:57,706
a circular slice of banana on your cheek.

349
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,249
Other side.

350
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,423
- My office. Now! Now, now.
- Okay.

351
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,806
Before you fire me,
I have something to say.

352
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,271
Clean my office, top to bottom.

353
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:26,068
And, uh, when you come in tomorrow,
try and remember to bring a brain.

354
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:28,278
That seems uncalled for.

355
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,740
I believe that lurking underneath

356
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,911
that starchy, half-size-too-small,
bum-clencher of a suit

357
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:40,666
lies a kind man who wants
to give a brilliant kid another shot.

358
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:48,882
Clean, now!

359
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,213
I just can't leave you looking like that.

360
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,798
It would be cruel.

361
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,025
Why'd you go to sleep in a window?

362
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,443
Who's... What...

363
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,493
Oh...

364
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,871
Oh, but seriously,
how much better do you look?

365
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,998
No! No!

366
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,168
Hello.

367
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,462
Out! Out!

368
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,756
Oh, farts.

369
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,719
Come with me. Leave the bag.

370
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,447
Thousand apologies.

371
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,597
Horace, no!

372
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,641
I'm calling the police, vandal.

373
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,185
She's coming!
The Baroness. She's out front.

374
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,104
- What?
- The Baroness!

375
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,188
She's coming!

376
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,314
No!

377
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,737
Hello. Is there a, uh, back way out, or...

378
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,114
The Baroness.

379
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,866
The fashion designer!
I want to see her.

380
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,587
Find the girl.

381
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,306
That's her.

382
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,663
Estella, they're distracted.

383
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,730
Let's go!

384
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,815
Baroness.

385
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,740
Outside. That window display.

386
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,784
I'm so sorry.

387
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,745
I can explain that.

388
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,246
You're right, time to go.

389
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,665
Sorry, Baroness...

390
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,751
Get her.

391
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:14,546
She's the vandal who messed up
the whole new window display.

392
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:15,714
Hello.

393
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,882
We're dealing with it.

394
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,926
All right, easy, easy, easy!

395
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,469
So she works here?

396
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,888
Oh, no, no. She was fired. Yeah.

397
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:27,601
We try to give these wretches a chance,
but, um, breeding.

398
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,478
Need I say more?

399
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,813
So she doesn't work here?

400
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,234
Sorry.
I'm not convinced I know...

401
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,820
You're sweating, and I can smell you.

402
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,155
Brilliant. Thank you.

403
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,368
You. Grubby girl.

404
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,452
Yes?

405
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:46,662
Jeffrey, card.

406
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,746
Card?

407
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,128
You're hired. This address.
5:00 a.m. Don't be late.

408
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,923
Teeth. Teeth.

409
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,011
You're a fool.

410
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,556
That girl put together
a better window display

411
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,974
than I've seen here for 10 years.

412
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,517
Hear, hear!

413
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,477
You were right, this is a very good shop.

414
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,523
God, it's all so depressing.

415
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,054
She liked my window, Jasper.
She liked my window!

416
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,264
I'm happy for you.

417
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,141
It's all thanks to you.

418
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,309
No.

419
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,269
So...

420
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,063
this was the angle, then?

421
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,319
It's funny how
those happy accidents

422
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,487
can change the whole direction
of your life.

423
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,200
Although, looking back,
"happy" may be the wrong word.

424
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,999
Ah, you.

425
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,960
Quickly, come on!

426
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,295
Right, okay.

427
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,133
Come along. Up here.

428
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,462
Silence!

429
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,029
My last show was a triumph.

430
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,117
Shall I read to you from Tattletale?

431
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:35,664
"Baroness designs stunned
with her reinvention of the A-line

432
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,375
"with a bias cut and higher line that...

433
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,591
"...reshapes the silhouette
in such an audacious way

434
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,760
"the audience broke into
rapturous applause at first sight.

435
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,305
"She really is a genius."

436
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,601
I'll read that bit again, shall I?

437
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,563
"She really is a genius."

438
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,024
A triumph.

439
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,735
Take a moment to revel in it.

440
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,704
Oh, that's enough. New show.
We must be perfect. Now go.

441
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,209
Window girl.

442
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,520
Grab a mannequin, some fabric,
and throw something together.

443
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,046
The Baroness needs looks.

444
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,465
Looks. Right.

445
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,655
It's foolish.

446
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,865
Unhinged.

447
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,410
Well, you're fired.

448
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:00,082
Pasty, pasty, pasty.

449
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,211
Hmm.

450
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,215
Why are you speaking?

451
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,092
I think you nicked me.

452
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,011
Just...

453
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,807
Fabrics! Can you get me a red like that?

454
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,841
Oh.

455
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,427
Welcome to Second Time Around,

456
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,138
I'm Artie or Art, as in "work of."

457
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,015
Wow! You look incredible.

458
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,517
I hear that all day,
so I guess it's true.

459
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,831
How does that look go on the streets?

460
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,730
Mmm, some abuse and insults, of course.

461
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:08,150
But I like to say that
normal is the cruelest insult of them all

462
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:09,484
and at least I never get that.

463
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,695
I couldn't agree more.

464
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,071
Look around, Cinderella.

465
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,324
I have everything a girl
or boy could ever want.

466
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,160
If you can dream it, I can dress it.

467
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,371
Dior, 1955, amazing.

468
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,085
Chanel, 1950. Spring collection.

469
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,755
Ah, you know your gowns.

470
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:33,008
You and I are going to be
very good friends, Artie.

471
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:37,137
Baroness, '65, in the window.
Winter collection.

472
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,931
I noticed that.

473
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,151
Grubby girl, get me lunch.

474
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,320
Soy salmon, lemon-zest risotto,

475
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:56,448
cucumber sliced into two-inch diagonals
at an eighth of an inch width

476
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,993
sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley,
shredded, not torn.

477
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,538
Right.

478
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,210
As the department stores
that stock your range,

479
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:12,047
we thought perhaps
we could give you some input.

480
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,173
Feedback.

481
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,676
Oh, great. I'll start, shall I?

482
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,427
My feedback.

483
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,226
You're short, you're fat,
you smell like an anchovy,

484
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:27,104
you're color-blind,
but you pretend you aren't.

485
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,524
You're a man
who can't take responsibility.

486
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,986
Your revenues are down 15%,
your foot traffic by 12 and a half.

487
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,779
Yes, I do my own research.

488
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,156
Your store hasn't been refurbished
since the Blitz.

489
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,826
People don't know whether to buy a frock
or duck and cover.

490
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:44,246
And most of the funds meant for refurbs
are being embezzled by you,

491
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:48,208
stashing them in Swiss bank
account number 32254766

492
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,043
to be precise.

493
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,672
That's me. Your turn.

494
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,966
I'm all ears.

495
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,931
Good day.

496
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,268
Imbeciles.

497
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,315
Lunch, now.

498
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,323
Oh. Finally, someone competent.

499
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,158
Whoa!

500
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,702
And someone not.
This is my lawyer, Roger.

501
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,223
Although he spends most of his time
playing piano in a dingy little bar,

502
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,082
actually, he's a good lawyer.

503
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,918
Hi.

504
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,044
Hi.

505
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,129
Piano's nice.

506
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,339
Yes.

507
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,132
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

508
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,383
Box up my lunch, Estella.

509
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,437
It could do with a lining.

510
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,150
You could use tulle to puff it out,
give it some body.

511
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,447
That's what I just said.

512
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,792
Baroness.

513
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,421
Keep up, Estella.

514
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:26,723
Jewels.

515
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:31,061
And, Estella, make the bodice

516
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:33,856
pencil thin.

517
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,744
Estella, did you make it pencil thin?

518
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,673
All right, how do I look?

519
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,925
- Fabulous.
- Well, I know that.

520
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,051
Show me.

521
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:07,306
Mmm.

522
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,349
How would you have done it?

523
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,237
Hmm.

524
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:25,032
I think you're...

525
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,911
something.

526
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,288
Come along.

527
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:42,341
I made this.

528
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:46,595
The Baroness said
she thinks I'm something.

529
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,639
I think that's good.

530
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:54,728
Everything's going so well, Mum.

531
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,025
I'm really trying to be
the Estella that you wanted.

532
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,529
Mostly. It's working.

533
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,324
I just wish you were here to see it.

534
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,664
There's something
about it that irritates me

535
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,416
and I always trust my instincts.

536
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:21,421
I thought maybe
if you tighten the silhouette...

537
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,674
Oh, you thought, did you?

538
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,551
I think it's better.

539
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,011
Actually, it is.

540
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,939
Your necklace.

541
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,108
Oh.

542
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,943
Family heirloom. Funny story, actually.

543
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,236
An employee once stole it.

544
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,320
No, she did not.

545
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,909
Sorry.

546
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,371
Slight tone delivery problem. I meant...

547
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:59,126
"No. She did not."
Did she work for you?

548
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:01,587
Mmm. Once. Years before.

549
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:03,881
She stole this,

550
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,550
was stupid enough to come back

551
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,552
and then she fell off a cliff and died.

552
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:10,429
How terrible.

553
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,615
Yes, it was, actually.
It was during my winter ball

554
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,309
and her death really overshadowed
the whole thing.

555
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,020
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

556
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,439
Who was the woman?

557
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,319
Not really the point of the story.

558
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,071
The story's about how lucky I am,
but anyway, she had a kid.

559
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,909
Kid's a snowflake.
Special, blah-blah-blah.

560
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,870
It was a basic shakedown
situation actually.

561
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:40,834
Maybe she...

562
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:43,003
Maybe she just really loved her kid.

563
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,173
Maybe she only had one person
to take care of

564
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,966
and she failed dismally.

565
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:08,487
Speak.

566
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,948
Baroness, we have that meeting
at the Ritz.

567
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,449
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

568
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,040
Necklace.
Roger, shoes.

569
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,627
Don't touch the ankle.

570
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:24,920
Yes, sorry. It's in.

571
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:26,088
Come along.

572
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,310
My mother hadn't
failed dismally, I had.

573
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,522
And I wasn't going to fail her again.

574
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,818
Told you, she always comes here.

575
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:51,738
Oi.

576
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:55,200
You all right?

577
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,412
She called my mum a thief.

578
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,789
Said she failed as a mother.

579
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,543
What? Your mum?
She knew your actual mum?

580
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,588
Yeah, it turns out
that was her party we were at.

581
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,965
Mum worked for her once.

582
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,310
I dropped the necklace
as I was running away.

583
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,678
She must've found it.

584
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,725
It's mine. So I'm taking it back.

585
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,393
- Taking it, as in...
- Stealing it.

586
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,519
Yeah.

587
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:26,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the angle.

588
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:37,117
Her Black and White Ball,
that's where we'll do it.

589
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:41,121
It's our biggest job ever.
Oi, Horace, attention.

590
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,874
We need to know
their security setup.

591
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,544
Power nap, nine minutes.

592
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:53,008
Where the cameras are.

593
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,345
Where the guards are posted.

594
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,807
And what the schedules are.

595
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,687
We need to know every detail
and every blind spot.

596
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,678
Okay,
the toilet's just on the left,

597
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:38,822
and then go straight down to the end.

598
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,180
Thanks.

599
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:56,738
Then, all we need to do
is disable the security system,

600
00:44:56,822 --> 00:45:00,576
bypass the cameras,
open the safe, steal the necklace

601
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:04,079
during the biggest party of the season.

602
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,040
So many people, her security
will be stretched to the limit

603
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:10,252
and just to be sure, a distraction,

604
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,421
where I get the key
to the keypad and safe.

605
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,298
Right, so what is the distraction?

606
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:18,218
I've discovered she likes to throw women
who offend her sensibilities

607
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:19,928
out of her parties.

608
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:22,973
- Old women. Women in gold.
- Ow!

609
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,850
Sad women.

610
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,518
Women who carry poodles.

611
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:30,022
But also stunningly dressed women
who pull the focus off of her.

612
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:32,399
What about one of the elderly broads?

613
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:35,194
Me, Horace. I will be the distraction.

614
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,737
All right.

615
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,782
Besides, wreaking havoc at galas
is my personal specialty.

616
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,369
Well, I don't know about that.
But here's a problem...

617
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:45,787
Won't she recognize you?

618
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,122
That's a good point.

619
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,433
- I guess.
- And when that happens,

620
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:49,499
won't you lose your job?

621
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,709
It's not on the board.

622
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,552
- A job I think you love.
- Are you thinking?

623
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:53,980
I mean, she sees you're talented, right?

624
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:55,088
Yes. Yes.

625
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:58,967
Well, maybe...
Maybe you don't need the necklace.

626
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,385
Maybe...

627
00:46:00,552 --> 00:46:02,346
Mate, come on! It's the angle.

628
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:04,389
- It's just a necklace.
- I want it back!

629
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,852
She's the boss.

630
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:12,898
And you're right.

631
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,069
You're right. She will recognize me.

632
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,280
So Estella can't go to the ball,

633
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,536
but I know someone who can.

634
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,591
Right, let's do it.

635
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,969
Yeah. Let's go and ruin someone's day.

636
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:44,388
You mean the Baroness?

637
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,808
Obviously, I mean the Baroness.

638
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:48,892
Right.

639
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,056
Why? Who did you think I...

640
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,103
No, you said "someone."

641
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,605
- Someone could be anyone...
- Let's just do this, Horace.

642
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,249
Not tonight, son.

643
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,711
Well, you know what?
They said it was an emergency.

644
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,421
This is a private event.

645
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:24,761
Kind of vermin I deal with,
they don't wait for an invitation.

646
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,098
What they do is, they get in,
they bite posh people

647
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:31,185
who then froth at the mouth,
their eyes spin in the back of their heads

648
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:32,769
and then the posh people die.

649
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:39,347
That's a beautiful story, mate.
I almost welled up, yeah?

650
00:47:39,443 --> 00:47:42,529
Freeze. Freeze.

651
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:46,033
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

652
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:53,290
Well, don't just stand there!
Get in and get him out!

653
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:56,210
I told you not to turn around.
And wash your hands.

654
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,128
Heck of a rat, yeah?

655
00:47:58,212 --> 00:48:00,756
The size of a dog. But it's a rat.

656
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:36,667
Miss Anita Darling.

657
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,168
Baroness.

658
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:41,088
I'm so grateful you've given Tattletale
an exclusive tonight.

659
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:45,717
Not apparently grateful enough
to observe the dress code.

660
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,722
No color.

661
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,934
Well, my pen must have leaked.
It's tools of my trade.

662
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,145
No one is interested
in what you write, my dear.

663
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,523
Just in how I look.

664
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:07,906
You look ravishing, Baroness.

665
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,951
Master of understatement, as usual.

666
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,335
Here's...

667
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:22,004
to me.

668
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,631
To the Baroness!

669
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,354
Do you have a light?

670
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,291
Get her.

671
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,379
Come on, Wink.

672
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,802
I'm a wee bit nervous.

673
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:13,490
This doesn't have to be a scene.

674
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,058
It really, really does.

675
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,731
My arm. I think it's broken.

676
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:24,608
Is there a doctor?

677
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:28,779
Oh, no, actually it's fine.

678
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:31,532
I'd like to remind you all
that I'm doing this in heels.

679
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,504
Ratbane! Abort! They can see you
on the cameras. Abort.

680
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:46,588
What?

681
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:56,223
There are six of you,
so obviously you'll win,

682
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,477
but the first two of you to arrive
are going to get very badly hurt.

683
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,771
Initiate plan B.

684
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,316
No, no, no!

685
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,945
Oh! Oh! Look at that one!

686
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:20,122
No. Get out! My wires!

687
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,458
So, discuss amongst yourselves
who that is, hmm?

688
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,586
There we are.

689
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,504
No, no, no.

690
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,256
You hideous freak.

691
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:30,779
I didn't mean that, Wink.

692
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,182
All right, we're good.

693
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,434
Oh! I'm so sorry.

694
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,520
Hang on!
We haven't started yet, darling.

695
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:47,065
Is that two? I lost count.

696
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,906
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just bring her to me.

697
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,075
Oi. Shh.

698
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,239
You're supposed to be dead!

699
00:51:58,327 --> 00:51:59,953
That's a bit much.

700
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,381
Nothing to see here.

701
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:18,931
Horace, how's it going?

702
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:20,307
How's it going? Well, I...

703
00:52:23,393 --> 00:52:24,520
Well, I'd say badly.

704
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,358
Oh, no.

705
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,111
Who are you?
You look vaguely familiar.

706
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,365
I look stunning.

707
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,075
I don't know about familiar, darling.

708
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,160
Your hair, is it real?

709
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:43,664
Black and White Ball.
I like to make an impact.

710
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,961
Right. What was your name?

711
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:52,506
Cruella.

712
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:54,216
- Oh.
- Mmm.

713
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:57,928
That's quite fabulous.
And you designed this?

714
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:01,723
You did, actually. 1965 collection.

715
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,559
Oh, no wonder I love it, it's mine.

716
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:04,726
I fixed it.

717
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:09,398
Oh, sit. Do, I insist.

718
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:13,777
I'm intrigued, and that never happens.

719
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,377
Yes. Aren't they gorgeous?

720
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,046
And vicious.

721
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,465
It's my favorite combination.

722
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:46,977
What do you want?

723
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,479
I mean, you clearly wanted
to get my attention.

724
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:54,401
I want to be like you.

725
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,779
You're a very powerful woman.

726
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,375
Let me give you some advice.

727
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:14,213
If you need to talk about power,
you don't have it.

728
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,316
Well, I don't have it, which is why

729
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,026
I need to talk about it,
which is why I'm here.

730
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,450
Am I going to have to catch you up a lot,
or can you keep up?

731
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:24,431
You're funny.

732
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:28,018
It's not just rats.
There's mice, lizards...

733
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:34,066
Raccoons. There's a whole mess
of different kinds of...

734
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:38,362
Oh, that's a hybrid.

735
00:54:43,408 --> 00:54:44,493
Where are you from?

736
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:47,246
Oh. Well, um...

737
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,998
Up...

738
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,544
north. Well, sort of.

739
00:54:56,129 --> 00:55:00,008
It's a bit south, really, of north,
which is basically west.

740
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:02,469
All right, that's enough.
I've loved our little chat,

741
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:06,723
but I'm afraid that now I'm going
to have to have you arrested, um, for

742
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:08,517
trespassing.

743
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,105
Oh. Is that a rat?

744
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,115
Oh, my God! Get it off!
Get it off! Get off!

745
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:25,826
Someone's stolen my necklace.

746
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:27,619
Later, boys.

747
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,547
Now it's a party!

748
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,969
That dog. Stop! Thief!

749
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,057
You're the bravest rat I've ever known.

750
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,398
Oh, we need that!

751
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:51,411
Well, here's hoping there's a plan C.

752
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:52,663
Why, what's plan C?

753
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:54,629
Well, what I'm saying is,
"Is there a plan C?"

754
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,999
Yeah, but...

755
00:56:57,543 --> 00:56:58,544
Get in!

756
00:56:58,752 --> 00:56:59,837
Yeah.

757
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:02,214
A bit quicker! You're a dog!

758
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,221
Whoa.

759
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,290
Didn't know you knew how to drive.

760
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,478
- Whoa...
- I don't.

761
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,105
There's a car!

762
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:31,451
All right. Stop the car!

763
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:39,209
What's going on?

764
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:42,838
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Where's she going?

765
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,059
The Baroness killed my mother.

766
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,895
What? What are you talking about?

767
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,814
Her whistle, she called the dogs on her,
she was...

768
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:03,817
It wasn't my fault.

769
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:06,945
She killed her.

770
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,156
Like she was nothing.

771
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:11,700
Oh, blimey.

772
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:26,423
They say there are
five stages of grief.

773
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:32,513
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

774
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,726
Well, I'd like to add one more.

775
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:41,271
Revenge.

776
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:44,233
We should lay low.

777
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:46,151
Yeah.

778
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:47,945
That was a bit much last night.

779
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:51,365
You think? I fell into a cake.

780
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,208
Morning, boys.

781
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,668
Morning.

782
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,552
So, let's begin.

783
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,020
You're not gonna kill her, are ya?

784
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:18,141
It's not part of the current plan,
but we might need to be adaptable.

785
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,351
So, that's a no?

786
00:59:19,518 --> 00:59:23,230
If you heard a "no," it is.
Now, the necklace.

787
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:24,940
One of the Dalmatians ate it.

788
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:27,651
Not sure which one,
so you'll need to kidnap all of them.

789
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:29,738
All right, sorry. Slow down.
What? What are we...

790
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:32,489
Darling, if I'm going to
need to repeat myself a lot,

791
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,283
this isn't going to work out.

792
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:37,292
Why you still talking like that?
Grift's over.

793
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,789
The necklace went in one end, yes?

794
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:44,126
It's going to come out the other.
That's how it works.

795
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:48,755
And what about breakfast?
Which is now on the floor.

796
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,692
What's the rest of the plan?
Where are you going?

797
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:52,176
Need-to-know basis.

798
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:53,969
But that's not how we usually...

799
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,556
- ...work.
- That was rude.

800
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,349
Yeah, but it's her mum, innit?

801
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:01,185
We gotta cut her some slack.
Help her out.

802
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,991
Well, it's not seeming like a lot of fun.

803
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:04,789
- My Krispies are on the floor.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

804
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:06,565
Let's just get the dogs.

805
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,783
Anita Darling, my darling.

806
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:24,458
Estella, it's been so long.

807
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,087
You know, I kept staring
at you at the party,

808
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,631
and then it came to me.

809
01:00:31,048 --> 01:00:32,925
That's Estella from school.

810
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:34,510
It's not Estella.

811
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:37,262
That's the past.

812
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,223
I'm Cruella.

813
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:47,773
So you go to parties and you take pictures
and you print gossip?

814
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,066
That's your job?

815
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,944
Yes, well. Not as fun as it sounds.

816
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,447
Oh, it doesn't sound fun.
It sounds useful.

817
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,449
Oh.

818
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:02,704
I'd like to start my own label.

819
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,125
Why don't we work together
to create some buzz

820
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:09,336
for this old rag

821
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:11,755
that you continually fill
with that old hag?

822
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:15,843
You have that glint in your eye.

823
01:01:16,677 --> 01:01:17,803
What glint?

824
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:21,640
Well, I'm starting to remember that

825
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:23,475
you have a bit of an extreme side.

826
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:30,315
Well, then you remember what fun that is?

827
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:37,197
Now, I want you to help me
tell them who I am.

828
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,713
You notice how some dog owners
look a lot like their dogs?

829
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,799
No. I've never noticed that.

830
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:58,552
What about now?

831
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:00,864
All right, let's have a bit of
professionalism, please, Horace.

832
01:02:00,888 --> 01:02:01,990
We got a job to do, all right?

833
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:04,725
Wink is a very likable dog.
I'm not sure this plan will work.

834
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:06,351
It'll work.

835
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,979
Remember, Wink, they can smell fear.

836
01:02:19,448 --> 01:02:21,700
Settle, Genghis.

837
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:36,340
Oi!

838
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,176
Told you it'd work.

839
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,513
How can you not love this face?

840
01:02:54,608 --> 01:02:55,651
It's you.

841
01:02:56,193 --> 01:02:59,279
It is. And you're reading about me.

842
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,156
And you're in my shop.

843
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:05,452
It's me, Estella.

844
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:11,792
Oh, my. My, my, my.
You look amazing.

845
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,754
You certainly made a splash.

846
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:19,049
I'm just getting started, darling.

847
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,093
And I need help.

848
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,929
I want to make art, Artie...

849
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:28,100
and I want to make trouble.
You in?

850
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:30,102
I do love trouble.

851
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,564
I'm not the enemy!
Stop that!

852
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,400
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, now. It's all right.

853
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,319
Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that! Hey!

854
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:40,806
Hey! Stop! Hey!

855
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:43,198
Oh, come on! Those aren't yours!

856
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:49,663
You got them.

857
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,374
Artie, boys.
Boys, Artie.

858
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,042
Artie will be working downstairs.

859
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,044
He actually knows something about fashion.

860
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:57,212
Dogs are very aggressive.

861
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,673
Well, you have to
walk them, feed them.

862
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:01,175
Get that necklace out.

863
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:04,178
Yeah, well, can't you walk 'em as well?
There's no "I" in team.

864
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:05,864
Well, there is an "I" in imbecile. Go!

865
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,848
Hey! No, no, no,
you can't talk to us like that.

866
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,099
We're helping you here.

867
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:10,642
So don't.

868
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,148
Oh.
Mummy and Daddy are fighting.

869
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:18,317
I'll, uh, set up downstairs.

870
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,111
You stop it. Chill. Just chill.

871
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:26,617
Come on, dogs. Regent's Park it is.

872
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,160
You could be more polite is all.

873
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:29,494
I don't have time.

874
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:31,371
I have to go to work.
I'm a designer now.

875
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:32,456
Seriously?

876
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:35,000
Keep your enemies close.

877
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:39,087
Voil?! Cruella was in a box a long time,

878
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,216
now Estella can be the one
who makes guest appearances.

879
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:48,972
Everyone is laughing at me.

880
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:52,226
Well, they say all press
is good press, Baroness.

881
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,562
Although they have focused
rather on the rats.

882
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,732
Did you happen to notice her hair?

883
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,110
Coincidence.

884
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:04,196
Apparently all the young people
are doing it now.

885
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:09,535
Thank you, John.
You're such an enormous...

886
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:11,787
help.

887
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,497
- I do my best.
- Mmm.

888
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:16,917
She wants you, hurry up.

889
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,211
Come on.

890
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:24,383
Ah. Here she is.

891
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,718
Late. Grab a pad.

892
01:05:28,178 --> 01:05:29,221
Excuse me.

893
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,431
Fashion fact.

894
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:34,601
The pinnacle of every London fashion year
is the spring collection.

895
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:35,769
Excuse me.

896
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:40,190
My spring collection.

897
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:44,069
I need 12 pieces, and I have...

898
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,488
Let me count.

899
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:53,370
I was going
to take the things she loved most...

900
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:54,746
her business,

901
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:58,000
her status...

902
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,126
Zero.

903
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:02,629
I need ten pieces that work by 3:00 a.m.

904
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,506
...her confidence.

905
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:07,593
Go.

906
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:11,096
Thank you.

907
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,723
Gratitude's for losers.

908
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,767
Oh. Good advice, thanks.

909
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,894
What did I just say?

910
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:19,069
Uh, don't thank you, so...

911
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,439
Got it. Thank you.

912
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:23,233
- Go.
- Going. So, I'll just...

913
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,444
Mmm?

914
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:27,424
What do you mean, the dogs have gone?

915
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,156
Well, find them!

916
01:06:33,744 --> 01:06:36,121
Horace. Game's on.

917
01:06:36,288 --> 01:06:37,414
Oh, tournaments...

918
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:40,792
Oh! You're kidding me! You animals!

919
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,045
I sleep on that thing.

920
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:45,672
I'm watching the game, forget it.

921
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,883
Oh, Tottenham fans.

922
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,093
So you're not all bad then.

923
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:54,264
Two minutes. Necklace?

924
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:57,726
No. But silence. That's a start.

925
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,896
And of course, "Thank you
for doing all my dirty work, guys."

926
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,732
"Hey, don't worry about it, we're a team."

927
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:11,865
Baroness! Over here!

928
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,414
"Cruella." Cruella.

929
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,332
What sort of a name is that anyway?

930
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:03,876
Okay. A proper competitor.

931
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:06,336
I'll just have to destroy her
as we have so many before.

932
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:10,674
Find her. And, Roger,
find out everything about her.

933
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:17,055
I'm more a lawyer than a detective, I...

934
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:18,473
Yes, I'll do that.

935
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:51,256
We have no signature piece.

936
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:55,928
And this Cruella person is everywhere.

937
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,805
I want ideas.

938
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:02,976
Estella, what've you got?

939
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,905
You seem upset.

940
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:18,283
My dogs are missing,
my necklace has been stolen

941
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,662
and this Cruella creature is...

942
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:24,873
This show has to be the best.

943
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,585
Can I get you some cucumber?
Thinly sliced.

944
01:09:32,965 --> 01:09:34,091
Go.

945
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:38,554
And get your dried-up,
desiccated little brain working.

946
01:09:38,762 --> 01:09:40,722
Of course. And thank you.

947
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,654
Yes, go to lunch, you lazy fools.

948
01:10:03,662 --> 01:10:04,872
Hmm.

949
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:21,305
What? Hey!

950
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:26,476
Mmm.

951
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,730
Oh, Estella, I am surprised at you
holding out on me.

952
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:32,691
But I was on my lunch break
in a public space.

953
01:10:32,858 --> 01:10:34,276
Yes, I own the alley.

954
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:36,528
Really? You can own alleys?

955
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:40,324
Alleys, designs, people, their souls.

956
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:43,869
Check your employment contract.

957
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,170
Well, I seem to have found
my new signature piece.

958
01:10:54,546 --> 01:10:55,881
How do you like it?

959
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:52,062
We need to sue her, for defamation,

960
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:54,690
false imprisonment, vandalism.
Something.

961
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:59,278
Well, having been through the statute
and talked to the police,

962
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:02,114
I don't know we have a legal avenue for...

963
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:04,408
I need you to stop talking, Roger.

964
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:05,576
You do?

965
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,578
So I have a gap to fire you.

966
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:10,956
There's a gap. You're fired.

967
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:13,834
Roger always blamed me
for getting him fired,

968
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,879
but the real reason
Roger was fired is because...

969
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:18,589
- Hmm.
- ...he's Roger.

970
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:26,847
You'll need more than eyeliner,
you plain little thing.

971
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:30,517
You do, however,
have an eye for a good shot.

972
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:31,643
Baroness.

973
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,854
Who is she?
And more importantly, where is she?

974
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:35,606
I don't know.

975
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:42,696
Did you just lie to me?

976
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:46,200
I... No, I...

977
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,702
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

978
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,168
You will.

979
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:19,858
Getting anything?

980
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:21,026
Come on!

981
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:22,861
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

982
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,572
You know, I'm worried about her.

983
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,324
What, Estella?

984
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:28,700
Yeah.

985
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,661
Oh, she's just playing a part
for the grift.

986
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,996
Rude part.
Hey! Stop that!

987
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,501
Where's the beading for the dress?

988
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:41,338
Ordered. Just waiting
on this idiot delivery man.

989
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,720
Oh, good day to you, missy.

990
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:50,973
Got some fashion items
that are most fashionable.

991
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,810
Thank you, most handsome delivery man.

992
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,188
It's...

993
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:41,940
Stunning.

994
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:44,693
Hmm.

995
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,447
I've done it again.

996
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:51,408
Let's go make history.

997
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:55,245
I need a drink. Estella, come.

998
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:15,432
Give it to me, for heaven's sake.

999
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,353
Go.

1000
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:28,654
Here's to me.

1001
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:36,453
Who the hell else would I drink to?

1002
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:39,456
To me?

1003
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:42,292
For creating your signature piece?

1004
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:44,878
You're helpful to me, is all.

1005
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:47,756
As soon as you're not, you're dust.

1006
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:49,508
Inspiring talk.

1007
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,468
Thank you.

1008
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:05,107
You can't care about anyone else.

1009
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:07,192
Everyone else is an obstacle.

1010
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:10,946
You care what an obstacle
wants or feels, you're dead.

1011
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,990
If I had cared about anyone or thing,

1012
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:15,242
I might have died
like so many brilliant women

1013
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:21,582
with a drawer full of unseen genius
and a heart full of sad bitterness.

1014
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,751
You have the talent for your own label.

1015
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:29,423
Whether you have the killer instinct
is the big question.

1016
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:37,556
I hope I do.

1017
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,308
Hmm.

1018
01:16:40,684 --> 01:16:43,020
Correct response. Well done.

1019
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:47,733
We just have to get rid of this...

1020
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,736
Cruella person, don't you think?

1021
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,863
Hmm.

1022
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:55,574
I guess you must hate her.

1023
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:58,243
Honestly?

1024
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,078
I'm conflicted.

1025
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,080
She is good.

1026
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,457
Bold and brilliant.

1027
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,086
But she has made it me or her...

1028
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:14,051
and I choose me.

1029
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:27,439
Well, this guy's
a bit of a blanket.

1030
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:30,192
What about...

1031
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:32,236
this?

1032
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,953
Really?

1033
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,122
We're gonna
have to get invasive.

1034
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:51,338
It's risky.

1035
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,591
They gotta know we broke in, Cruella said.

1036
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,512
Yeah, she did, didn't she?

1037
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,723
Yeah, I'm getting
a little tired of Cruella.

1038
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:02,975
Oh, yeah.

1039
01:18:27,124 --> 01:18:28,750
What's going on?

1040
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:33,881
She tried to break in last night.

1041
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:35,716
Who did?

1042
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:37,509
Cruella. Well, it makes sense.

1043
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:40,888
It's a stunning,
ludicrously expensive gown.

1044
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:42,556
Cruella could never afford to make it.

1045
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:43,724
Hmm.

1046
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:46,643
But Cruella has no shame.

1047
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:48,562
She may steal my creation.

1048
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:51,607
I mean, that's a very good idea, right,
if you were...

1049
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:53,233
her?

1050
01:19:17,966 --> 01:19:22,346
Night. Get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

1051
01:19:22,513 --> 01:19:24,313
Play nice, guys.

1052
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:27,142
Night.

1053
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:47,996
What?

1054
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:50,249
I miss Estella.

1055
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:53,836
Goal!

1056
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:59,091
They really would make fabulous coats.

1057
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:00,300
The dogs?

1058
01:20:05,806 --> 01:20:06,807
I'm joking.

1059
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:09,768
You know what I miss?

1060
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:11,287
The Jasper who had a sense of humor.

1061
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,312
Right.

1062
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:14,290
You know, we've all had
bad things happen to us.

1063
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,567
Me, him, you. But we've always
been there for each other.

1064
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:19,945
That's all I'm asking.
Is it so hard to back me up?

1065
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:24,324
No. Not Estella, that's easy,
but to help Cruella,

1066
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,201
it's a nightmare.

1067
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,413
And there's that
understatement thing you do.

1068
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:31,748
Cruella gets things done.

1069
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:33,500
Estella does not.

1070
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,711
And I have things to do.

1071
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,588
So if you're done chatting.

1072
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,800
And by "if," I mean you are.

1073
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,198
I'll allow it.

1074
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,054
When Estella arrives,

1075
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:29,097
escort her to my office
and hold her there.

1076
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:30,265
Very good.

1077
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,977
Although I think you're wrong.
It's not her.

1078
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:36,605
Do I pay you for your opinions
or for your obedience?

1079
01:21:37,147 --> 01:21:38,732
Well, are you asking my opinion?

1080
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:42,444
I'll see it's done.

1081
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,420
Speak.

1082
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:03,966
What do you mean, it's stuck?

1083
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,051
The guests are already arriving.

1084
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:07,261
Oh!

1085
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:10,138
There's something wrong with the lock,
Your Ladyship.

1086
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:13,141
I don't care what you have to do,
get it open!

1087
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:11,909
That little...

1088
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:30,969
Ladies and gentlemen,

1089
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,847
I present to you...

1090
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,982
Cruella!

1091
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,267
It's got a good beat.

1092
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,145
The music.

1093
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:55,679
She killed my dogs.

1094
01:24:59,141 --> 01:25:02,769
And made a coat.

1095
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,335
Oi! Get out! Come on!

1096
01:25:30,714 --> 01:25:33,008
Oh, how lovely of her
to thank us for our work.

1097
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:34,718
Yeah, real gracious, wasn't she?

1098
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,824
After all we've done for her.

1099
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:42,248
Whatever happened to that cute
little girl crying on a bench?

1100
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:43,435
She's gone, mate.

1101
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,524
We should've left her on that park bench.

1102
01:25:56,406 --> 01:25:57,616
Madam, welcome.

1103
01:25:57,699 --> 01:26:00,118
- Mmm. Hello.
- Anything I can get you, please?

1104
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:02,412
- Oh, uh, two lamb korma.
- Okay.

1105
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:04,581
One tandoori chicken, and rice all round.

1106
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:05,832
No problem. No problem.

1107
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:09,378
A fashion riot in Regent's Park
broke out today.

1108
01:26:09,628 --> 01:26:12,297
Cruella, some call her a designer,

1109
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:13,841
- others a vandal.
- Hmm.

1110
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:18,262
Questions are being raised
over whether her coat was real Dalmatian.

1111
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:20,514
Madam, are you celebrating?

1112
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:22,933
Oh, indeed I am.

1113
01:26:33,235 --> 01:26:35,654
The queen is dead!

1114
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,367
Long live the queen.

1115
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:48,709
Cruella.

1116
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:49,877
Wow.

1117
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,754
You really are a psycho.

1118
01:26:54,089 --> 01:26:56,258
Why, how nice of you to say.

1119
01:26:57,134 --> 01:26:58,594
You showed promise,

1120
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:02,890
as did Estella.

1121
01:27:03,432 --> 01:27:05,934
Oh, am I late for work?

1122
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:08,854
Gee whiz, boss, how was the show?

1123
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:12,274
This is between us.

1124
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:14,401
Let Jasper and Horace,

1125
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:17,988
imbeciles that they are
for letting you follow them, let them go.

1126
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:22,367
Oh, I shall. They're going to jail.

1127
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:23,660
For what?

1128
01:27:24,494 --> 01:27:25,495
Dognapping?

1129
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:26,997
Your murder.

1130
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:31,418
No one will believe that.

1131
01:27:31,919 --> 01:27:35,214
Well, I'll have to add your
charred body to the mix

1132
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:38,800
to help the believability factor.

1133
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:40,594
Almost.

1134
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:46,183
Come on, you. Come on.

1135
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:47,726
Oh, that's nice.

1136
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:51,605
You're going to kill me
because I upstaged you?

1137
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:54,691
Uh-huh.

1138
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:01,573
I know you killed my mother.

1139
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,243
You're going to have to be more specific.

1140
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:05,786
What?

1141
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:09,540
Who exactly?

1142
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,292
Just narrow it down for me.

1143
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:13,710
On a cliff.

1144
01:28:14,837 --> 01:28:16,213
You called your dogs on her.

1145
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:20,092
Okay. Now I'm with you.

1146
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:22,386
Oh, that's why you're peeved.

1147
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,514
Hence this little show.

1148
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:31,311
I'm gonna kill you. And your dogs.

1149
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:36,066
I'm waiting.

1150
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:41,989
Gents,

1151
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:47,077
will you let me go for a moment?

1152
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:50,247
Come on.
I'm sure she's a terrible boss.

1153
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:53,208
Enough.

1154
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:07,055
Goodbye, Cruella.

1155
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:13,604
Dogs.

1156
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:21,695
Bad dog, Genghis.

1157
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:23,113
I'll tip off the press.

1158
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,491
I'd love them to know
that you went out in a

1159
01:29:27,784 --> 01:29:28,952
blaze of glory.

1160
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,705
Hold it there. Up there.

1161
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:19,670
Move back!
It's still a dangerous scene.

1162
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:21,033
Please, I need you to move back.

1163
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:23,657
Breaking news,

1164
01:30:23,799 --> 01:30:27,427
Cruella, best known for upstaging
the Baroness in the fashion world,

1165
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:28,804
has died tonight.

1166
01:30:29,012 --> 01:30:30,448
London's
fashion provocateur has died.

1167
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,659
The Baroness and Cruella
had been going head-to-head...

1168
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:34,911
The Baroness' competition
has gone up in flames.

1169
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:38,355
Cruella, a shining star
in London's West End fashion scene

1170
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:41,775
has tragically died tonight
in a warehouse fire.

1171
01:30:54,872 --> 01:30:55,873
What?

1172
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:01,920
Tea, Miss Cruella?

1173
01:31:03,338 --> 01:31:04,590
Why am I alive?

1174
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:06,651
Because I dragged you
out of the smoke and flames

1175
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:07,718
before they consumed you.

1176
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,641
I have something for you.

1177
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:23,901
You found it?

1178
01:31:24,067 --> 01:31:25,194
In the fire.

1179
01:31:26,737 --> 01:31:30,490
I can assure you it's been,
uh, thoroughly bleached.

1180
01:31:32,284 --> 01:31:33,285
May I show you something?

1181
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,543
I didn't know it had a key.

1182
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:43,337
Mmm-hmm.

1183
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:46,590
What's it to?

1184
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:48,425
This.

1185
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:07,653
The Baroness has a kid?

1186
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:09,821
You.

1187
01:32:13,742 --> 01:32:15,035
May I walk you through it?

1188
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:19,289
The Baron was a sweet old guy.

1189
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:23,252
The Baroness, on the other hand,
she's a true narcissist.

1190
01:32:25,546 --> 01:32:27,381
So when she found out she was pregnant...

1191
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:28,674
I'm pregnant.

1192
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:30,259
...she wasn't exactly thrilled.

1193
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,262
The Baron was delighted.

1194
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:36,223
So much so that he surprised her
by giving her a family heirloom.

1195
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:39,059
She took the necklace,
but she had other plans for you.

1196
01:32:39,142 --> 01:32:40,143
Stop.

1197
01:32:41,103 --> 01:32:42,312
You keep saying "you."

1198
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:44,606
You are her daughter.

1199
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:47,067
I was there when you were born.

1200
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:50,421
The Baron was away on business,
and she ordered me to do the unthinkable.

1201
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:51,488
You know what to do.

1202
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:54,449
It was a diabolical request.

1203
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:57,995
I knew I needed to protect you. But how?

1204
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:00,747
Then I saw Catherine,

1205
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,666
the sweetest woman who ever lived.

1206
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,376
She saved you.

1207
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,546
The Baroness said the child had died.

1208
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:13,677
The Baron, he, uh, wasted away.

1209
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:17,097
The point I'm making is,

1210
01:33:17,264 --> 01:33:21,101
you are the rightful heir
to the Baron's entire fortune.

1211
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,771
The mansion, the title. Everything.

1212
01:33:24,938 --> 01:33:27,649
That psycho cannot be my mother.

1213
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,069
No.

1214
01:33:45,918 --> 01:33:46,919
Oi!

1215
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:07,666
So this is a confusing day.

1216
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:12,212
My nemesis

1217
01:35:13,755 --> 01:35:15,841
is my real mother

1218
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:21,430
and she killed my other mother.

1219
01:35:25,309 --> 01:35:27,311
I guess you were always scared,

1220
01:35:28,187 --> 01:35:32,482
weren't you, that I'd be a psycho

1221
01:35:33,901 --> 01:35:35,819
like my real mum?

1222
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:37,738
Hmm?

1223
01:35:40,616 --> 01:35:45,621
That explains all the
"tone it down, try and fit in" stuff.

1224
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:52,127
Love me into shape,
I suppose, was the plan.

1225
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:02,054
And I tried.

1226
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:06,808
I really, I tried because

1227
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:09,978
I loved you.

1228
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:16,401
But the thing is...

1229
01:36:18,987 --> 01:36:20,239
I'm...

1230
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:25,744
not sweet Estella,

1231
01:36:27,287 --> 01:36:28,747
try as I might.

1232
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:33,168
I never was.

1233
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:40,759
I'm Cruella,

1234
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:46,098
born brilliant,

1235
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:48,851
born bad

1236
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:53,188
and a little bit mad.

1237
01:36:58,026 --> 01:36:59,778
I am not like her.

1238
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:04,616
I'm better.

1239
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:09,162
Anyway,

1240
01:37:10,622 --> 01:37:11,915
must dash.

1241
01:37:12,624 --> 01:37:15,669
Much to avenge, revenge and destroy.

1242
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,098
But I do love you.

1243
01:37:30,934 --> 01:37:32,436
Always.

1244
01:37:41,987 --> 01:37:45,157
The boys are locked up,
but we have a problem.

1245
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:47,618
I don't pay you for problems.

1246
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:49,745
We didn't find her body.

1247
01:37:49,912 --> 01:37:50,972
What are you talking about?

1248
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:52,873
It's on the TV, the radio.

1249
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,709
Well, someone tipped them off

1250
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:57,294
and gave them the wrong tip.

1251
01:38:02,508 --> 01:38:04,134
Thank you for your time.

1252
01:38:04,301 --> 01:38:06,553
Incompetent as always.

1253
01:38:22,528 --> 01:38:26,532
You're in the way.

1254
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:44,633
I still can't believe she's dead.

1255
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:50,055
Pull it together, H.
You can't cry in prison.

1256
01:38:50,973 --> 01:38:52,224
Yeah.

1257
01:38:52,391 --> 01:38:54,101
Let's just remember Estella.

1258
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:55,519
- Estella.
- Estella.

1259
01:38:55,686 --> 01:38:56,728
No crying.

1260
01:38:56,895 --> 01:38:58,397
Forget Cruella.

1261
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,076
Shh!

1262
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:13,662
Did you hear that?

1263
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,373
I heard something.

1264
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:45,861
Oi, come here!

1265
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:52,813
Stay behind and
keep an eye on the prisoners!

1266
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:07,007
What?

1267
01:40:07,216 --> 01:40:08,300
Hey.

1268
01:40:09,718 --> 01:40:11,053
- Wink!
- Shh!

1269
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:12,221
Wink!

1270
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,224
You ain't barbecued!

1271
01:40:16,058 --> 01:40:17,392
What in the bloody...

1272
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:18,936
Thank you.

1273
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:21,230
You're getting kissed right on the mouth!

1274
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:22,856
I don't care where it's been!

1275
01:41:20,455 --> 01:41:21,456
Want a ride?

1276
01:41:21,623 --> 01:41:23,667
- Yeah, we'll walk, thanks.
- You're alive!

1277
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:24,751
Oi!

1278
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:26,813
Yeah, I've had enough
of being treated like a dog,

1279
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:28,672
thank you.
No offense, Wink.

1280
01:41:28,839 --> 01:41:30,299
You'll get caught by the cops.

1281
01:41:30,465 --> 01:41:32,777
We did fine before you showed up,
we'll do fine without you.

1282
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:33,802
Yeah, exactly.

1283
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:34,928
I fancy a fry-up.

1284
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:37,407
- Yeah, I fancy a fry-up without her.
- Yeah, me too.

1285
01:41:37,431 --> 01:41:39,057
There's no easy way to say this.

1286
01:41:42,978 --> 01:41:44,771
The Baroness is my birth mother.

1287
01:41:51,278 --> 01:41:52,988
You just blew my mind.

1288
01:41:53,155 --> 01:41:55,115
It does explain a lot.

1289
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:58,535
She gave me away to die.

1290
01:41:59,703 --> 01:42:02,581
And then killed the sweetest woman,

1291
01:42:02,748 --> 01:42:04,082
albeit a liar,

1292
01:42:04,249 --> 01:42:05,667
who ever lived.

1293
01:42:10,964 --> 01:42:13,675
Well, thank you for the crumpets
and the crazy story.

1294
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:15,761
Good luck with that.

1295
01:42:15,928 --> 01:42:17,614
- I might take a few of these.
- Jasper!

1296
01:42:17,638 --> 01:42:19,473
We're in a kill-or-be-killed
situation here.

1297
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,601
Yeah, and she's a homicidal maniac,
and you're not.

1298
01:42:22,768 --> 01:42:25,979
Well, we don't know that yet.
I'm still young.

1299
01:42:26,813 --> 01:42:28,065
It's funny.

1300
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:29,918
Or it would be,
if I knew you were being funny.

1301
01:42:29,942 --> 01:42:30,943
No, not funny.

1302
01:42:31,026 --> 01:42:32,444
I'm joking, I'm joking!

1303
01:42:32,611 --> 01:42:34,905
The point is, I can't run.

1304
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:37,783
She'll find me, Jasper.
You know she will.

1305
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:39,284
We have to stop her.

1306
01:42:43,747 --> 01:42:45,332
I went a bit mad.

1307
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:47,876
I'm sorry.

1308
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:52,339
You're my family.

1309
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,134
You're all I have.

1310
01:43:02,558 --> 01:43:04,810
- She used the family card.
- Yeah, she did.

1311
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:06,436
It's working.

1312
01:43:06,603 --> 01:43:08,647
Yeah. All right, fine.

1313
01:43:10,566 --> 01:43:11,900
So what's the plan?

1314
01:43:16,822 --> 01:43:19,533
The Baroness' charity gala
is this weekend.

1315
01:43:20,409 --> 01:43:22,804
We're going to need the home addresses
and measurements of all the guests.

1316
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:23,829
Easy.

1317
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:25,956
Artie's tribe of dressmakers, of course.

1318
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:27,541
I like him.

1319
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:29,418
A black cape, pots of paint.

1320
01:43:29,501 --> 01:43:30,502
Oh, yeah?

1321
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:31,837
Several boned corsets...

1322
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:33,463
Should we write this down?

1323
01:43:35,299 --> 01:43:37,301
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize there'd be company.

1324
01:43:37,634 --> 01:43:39,928
John, this is my family.

1325
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:41,889
They'll be staying a while.

1326
01:43:42,055 --> 01:43:43,390
Hiya.

1327
01:43:44,016 --> 01:43:45,767
You're out of crumpets.

1328
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:58,530
We're closed.

1329
01:44:01,408 --> 01:44:03,136
I was just reading about you,

1330
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,828
the puppy killer.

1331
01:44:04,995 --> 01:44:07,039
Oh, well, I do love spots.

1332
01:44:07,497 --> 01:44:08,874
You didn't.

1333
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:10,626
I didn't.

1334
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:13,128
But people do need a villain
to believe in,

1335
01:44:13,295 --> 01:44:14,922
so I'm happy to fit the bill.

1336
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,548
Fabulous.

1337
01:44:18,592 --> 01:44:20,511
Small point, aren't you dead?

1338
01:44:20,677 --> 01:44:22,888
I am. Yes.

1339
01:44:23,055 --> 01:44:24,431
Sad, really.

1340
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,517
But also helpful.

1341
01:44:27,184 --> 01:44:30,020
Now, Artie, I have a plan.

1342
01:44:30,187 --> 01:44:31,563
Of course you do.

1343
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:33,273
And you're going to help me with it.

1344
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,025
Mmm. What do I get?

1345
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:39,404
A night of fabulousness
and mayhem and possible death.

1346
01:44:39,571 --> 01:44:42,658
Check, check, not quite sure
about the death though.

1347
01:44:42,824 --> 01:44:44,076
It won't be you.

1348
01:44:44,243 --> 01:44:45,494
Mmm. I'll get my coat.

1349
01:45:36,628 --> 01:45:37,838
For me?

1350
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,526
Heya.

1351
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:06,533
Sorry.

1352
01:46:10,746 --> 01:46:11,788
Big night.

1353
01:46:12,164 --> 01:46:13,373
Indeed it is.

1354
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,167
Sure about this?

1355
01:46:20,797 --> 01:46:22,341
No, I'm being serious.

1356
01:46:22,508 --> 01:46:23,926
And you're cute when you are.

1357
01:46:25,385 --> 01:46:26,470
Okay.

1358
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:30,057
I know you're in pain.

1359
01:46:30,265 --> 01:46:31,433
Mmm.

1360
01:46:31,517 --> 01:46:33,227
And I know that she caused it,

1361
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:37,814
but, you know, killing her
is not gonna make that go away.

1362
01:46:41,818 --> 01:46:43,111
I won't.

1363
01:46:45,113 --> 01:46:46,114
I promise.

1364
01:46:46,198 --> 01:46:47,616
All right, cool. Groovy.

1365
01:46:49,701 --> 01:46:51,787
Unless I really, really have to.

1366
01:46:57,584 --> 01:46:58,919
Thanks for helping me.

1367
01:47:00,546 --> 01:47:03,173
Yeah, well, I find it very difficult
saying no to you sometimes.

1368
01:47:06,218 --> 01:47:08,178
It's one of the things I love about you.

1369
01:47:09,304 --> 01:47:10,556
Thanks?

1370
01:47:17,145 --> 01:47:19,773
When I fixed it,
I noticed a name.

1371
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,859
Do you know what this car's called?

1372
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:24,111
A Devil!

1373
01:47:25,404 --> 01:47:26,864
It's DeVille, mate.

1374
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:28,740
DeVille.

1375
01:47:30,868 --> 01:47:32,369
I like that.

1376
01:47:36,164 --> 01:47:38,166
Come on. Stand to attention.

1377
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,835
Stand up straight.

1378
01:47:39,918 --> 01:47:40,919
Good.

1379
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:42,004
It's time.

1380
01:47:50,429 --> 01:47:51,638
Psst!

1381
01:47:56,476 --> 01:48:00,355
When I said, all those years ago,
"Take care of it,"

1382
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:02,608
what did you think I meant?

1383
01:48:03,066 --> 01:48:04,943
Well, I was a little confused.

1384
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:07,863
I hardly thought you meant

1385
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:10,032
you wanted me to kill your only child.

1386
01:48:13,285 --> 01:48:14,620
And I thought

1387
01:48:14,703 --> 01:48:16,830
we knew each other.

1388
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:20,667
Well?

1389
01:48:20,834 --> 01:48:22,794
I hope for your sake,
she's hidden in your coat.

1390
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:24,421
No, Baroness.

1391
01:48:28,759 --> 01:48:30,135
George, come here.

1392
01:48:36,225 --> 01:48:37,267
She'll be here tonight.

1393
01:48:37,351 --> 01:48:38,894
I want her caught before she's seen.

1394
01:48:39,061 --> 01:48:40,729
Everyone thinks she's dead.

1395
01:48:40,896 --> 01:48:42,773
She better be that way
by the end of the night.

1396
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:45,526
I've got a special treat for her.

1397
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:48,195
It'll put a shock through her
and leave her incapacitated.

1398
01:48:48,987 --> 01:48:50,155
Give it to me.

1399
01:48:53,367 --> 01:48:54,826
Hmm.

1400
01:48:56,119 --> 01:48:57,496
That's marvelous.

1401
01:48:59,414 --> 01:49:02,209
Oh, I could do that all day!

1402
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:04,628
Oh! Just find her, you idiots!

1403
01:49:11,677 --> 01:49:14,888
Why am I the only one who's competent?

1404
01:49:16,014 --> 01:49:17,224
Must be very tiring.

1405
01:49:19,351 --> 01:49:21,687
Should be a memorable night tonight,
Baroness.

1406
01:49:21,854 --> 01:49:23,605
Indeed it should.

1407
01:49:37,786 --> 01:49:40,622
All right, boys, look alert.
First vehicle arriving.

1408
01:49:47,629 --> 01:49:49,298
Blimey, it's her.

1409
01:49:52,676 --> 01:49:54,887
- Oh.
- I beg your pardon.

1410
01:49:55,053 --> 01:49:56,388
It's not her.

1411
01:49:58,640 --> 01:49:59,975
Here she is, here.

1412
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:04,688
That's not her.

1413
01:50:07,482 --> 01:50:09,443
- How dare you touch me!
- Sorry, ma'am.

1414
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:11,278
What's going on?

1415
01:50:11,862 --> 01:50:14,281
Time for my entrance, my dears.

1416
01:50:14,448 --> 01:50:15,949
- Baroness, I...
- Is she here?

1417
01:50:16,116 --> 01:50:17,556
Well, that's the problem, see, uh...

1418
01:50:20,412 --> 01:50:21,580
Police. How can I help?

1419
01:50:21,747 --> 01:50:24,750
There's a robbery planned
for Hellman Hall this evening.

1420
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:26,585
Who is this?

1421
01:50:40,641 --> 01:50:42,410
All teams, Baroness requires

1422
01:50:42,434 --> 01:50:44,144
everybody in the library now.

1423
01:50:44,311 --> 01:50:45,771
She's angry, boys.

1424
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,341
I was just looking for the loo.

1425
01:51:15,843 --> 01:51:16,885
Shh.

1426
01:51:17,928 --> 01:51:19,388
Oh.

1427
01:52:08,645 --> 01:52:11,857
Thank you all for coming.

1428
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:16,778
What a great tribute to our dear friend

1429
01:52:19,281 --> 01:52:22,367
who shall never return.

1430
01:52:23,535 --> 01:52:24,828
Sadly.

1431
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:27,414
Touching.

1432
01:52:27,915 --> 01:52:29,833
- To Cruella.
- To Cruella!

1433
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,460
Bravo!

1434
01:52:55,526 --> 01:52:58,487
That dog is like a son to me.

1435
01:52:58,570 --> 01:52:59,571
You're dead!

1436
01:53:03,283 --> 01:53:04,326
I had him.

1437
01:53:04,493 --> 01:53:06,453
Did you, though?

1438
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:20,551
Where is she?

1439
01:53:20,717 --> 01:53:22,344
Didn't you just toast her death?

1440
01:53:48,662 --> 01:53:50,873
Where are my guards?

1441
01:54:26,742 --> 01:54:30,245
She's here. I can feel it.

1442
01:54:32,539 --> 01:54:34,249
Find her.

1443
01:54:52,935 --> 01:54:54,478
Push!

1444
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:04,173
Get her!

1445
01:56:12,556 --> 01:56:13,891
Sit.

1446
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,289
Hello, Cruella.

1447
01:56:38,081 --> 01:56:41,877
I hate to ruin your party,
but I've come to evict you.

1448
01:56:43,462 --> 01:56:45,589
Don't be absurd.

1449
01:56:46,507 --> 01:56:49,176
This is the key that was in the necklace

1450
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:53,013
that unlocks the box
my birth certificate was in.

1451
01:56:56,225 --> 01:56:59,186
Hello, Mother.

1452
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:06,151
It all makes sense now.

1453
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:07,611
What?

1454
01:57:09,071 --> 01:57:11,323
That you're so extraordinary.

1455
01:57:11,490 --> 01:57:13,951
Of course, you're mine.

1456
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:18,747
I've longed for someone in my life

1457
01:57:18,914 --> 01:57:21,333
who was as good as me.

1458
01:57:22,918 --> 01:57:25,087
You left me to die.

1459
01:57:26,129 --> 01:57:27,464
A mistake.

1460
01:57:29,091 --> 01:57:31,927
And one we can get past. I know it.

1461
01:57:32,928 --> 01:57:34,263
I disagree.

1462
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:36,056
Good evening.

1463
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:38,100
The Baroness asks that you join her

1464
01:57:38,183 --> 01:57:39,268
- on the terrace.
- Lovely.

1465
01:57:39,434 --> 01:57:42,145
Gentlemen, the Baroness would like
to invite you outside, please.

1466
01:57:42,938 --> 01:57:44,690
You're not here for revenge.

1467
01:57:45,232 --> 01:57:47,568
You're here because
you're a brilliant designer

1468
01:57:47,651 --> 01:57:48,944
and a wicked genius

1469
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:53,448
and you need to be among your own kind.

1470
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:55,450
Me.

1471
01:57:56,243 --> 01:57:57,911
Your real mother.

1472
01:57:59,162 --> 01:58:00,914
Who made a mistake

1473
01:58:01,874 --> 01:58:06,003
and let something extraordinary go.

1474
01:58:08,672 --> 01:58:12,509
We are very alike, I suppose.

1475
01:58:18,765 --> 01:58:20,767
Good evening.
Madam, ravishing as always.

1476
01:58:20,934 --> 01:58:23,896
The Baroness requests
your presence outside.

1477
01:58:29,651 --> 01:58:32,154
I'm sorry.

1478
01:58:36,783 --> 01:58:37,784
You are?

1479
01:58:39,661 --> 01:58:40,871
I am.

1480
01:58:46,543 --> 01:58:48,253
Can I hug you?

1481
01:58:52,883 --> 01:58:54,051
Yes.

1482
01:59:11,276 --> 01:59:13,946
You're not going to push me
off the cliff, are you?

1483
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:16,990
You're so funny, dear.

1484
01:59:17,991 --> 01:59:19,618
So funny.

1485
01:59:21,036 --> 01:59:22,037
I love it.

1486
01:59:36,510 --> 01:59:37,511
Idiot.

1487
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:49,565
She jumped.

1488
01:59:50,357 --> 01:59:51,900
Did you see? She jumped.

1489
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:59,366
She tried to drag me with her.

1490
01:59:59,533 --> 02:00:01,577
She jumped, she jumped, she jumped.

1491
02:00:04,454 --> 02:00:05,998
Why are you looking at me like that?

1492
02:00:06,206 --> 02:00:07,666
Oh.

1493
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:10,419
She jumped!

1494
02:00:11,461 --> 02:00:15,340
What are you doing with those handcuffs?
She jumped!

1495
02:00:19,636 --> 02:00:22,764
So I told you I died.

1496
02:00:22,931 --> 02:00:25,100
Estella, that is.

1497
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:28,437
Poor thing.

1498
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:31,106
She couldn't even get anyone
to come to her own funeral.

1499
02:00:34,776 --> 02:00:37,362
That seemed like an unhappy ending.

1500
02:00:38,739 --> 02:00:40,824
Murdered tragically

1501
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:43,660
by her very own mother.

1502
02:00:43,827 --> 02:00:44,912
Idiot.

1503
02:00:45,746 --> 02:00:46,830
A few things.

1504
02:00:47,206 --> 02:00:48,624
Before she died,

1505
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:51,126
Estella willed her fortune
to her dear friend...

1506
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:52,878
Cruella de Vil.

1507
02:01:03,013 --> 02:01:04,890
Can't you idiots see?

1508
02:01:05,057 --> 02:01:08,352
That Estella person, it's a trick.

1509
02:01:08,519 --> 02:01:09,686
She's really Cruella.

1510
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:11,438
Cruella de Vil.

1511
02:01:12,022 --> 02:01:16,109
It's spelled "Devil,"
but it's pronounced "de Vil."

1512
02:01:17,486 --> 02:01:19,738
You wait, I'll get even.

1513
02:01:20,906 --> 02:01:22,866
The good thing
about evil people is

1514
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:27,329
you can always trust them
to do something, well,

1515
02:01:28,038 --> 02:01:29,706
evil.

1516
02:01:30,541 --> 02:01:32,084
Estella would die like her mother did.

1517
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:33,836
But not quite.

1518
02:01:39,925 --> 02:01:42,928
A well-cut skirt is a lifesaver, girls.

1519
02:01:44,054 --> 02:01:45,138
Remember that.

1520
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:57,109
She'd go to prison
for throwing someone off a cliff.

1521
02:01:58,318 --> 02:02:00,112
Wrong someone, but there's something about

1522
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:03,115
poetic justice that's just so

1523
02:02:04,741 --> 02:02:06,076
poetic.

1524
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,454
Goodbye, Estella.

1525
02:02:15,961 --> 02:02:18,046
She was with her mother now.

1526
02:02:18,213 --> 02:02:20,132
I'll take it from here.

1527
02:02:20,716 --> 02:02:23,135
But Cruella was alive.

1528
02:02:23,302 --> 02:02:25,554
All right, we should put on
some music or something.

1529
02:02:25,721 --> 02:02:27,097
Lighten the mood.

1530
02:02:29,057 --> 02:02:31,435
She's not actually dead, mate. She's...

1531
02:02:36,565 --> 02:02:39,902
How can you not get choked up at all this?

1532
02:02:42,487 --> 02:02:44,031
Oh, man.

1533
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:47,910
And I call that a happy ending.

1534
02:03:51,139 --> 02:03:53,976
Has, uh, Genghis put on a bit of weight?

1535
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,626
So, what now?

1536
02:04:25,549 --> 02:04:27,634
I've got a few ideas.

1537
02:04:37,060 --> 02:04:41,315
Cruella de Vil
Cruella de Vil

1538
02:04:41,690 --> 02:04:43,901
She's born to be bad

1539
02:04:43,984 --> 02:04:46,486
So run for the hills

1540
02:04:46,570 --> 02:04:51,158
Cruella de Vil
Cruella de Vil

1541
02:04:51,283 --> 02:04:53,535
The fear on your face

1542
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,246
It gives me a thrill

1543
02:04:56,747 --> 02:04:58,790
Who wants to be nice?

1544
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:01,084
Who wants to be tame?

1545
02:05:01,168 --> 02:05:03,045
All of you good guys

1546
02:05:03,128 --> 02:05:05,297
Y'all seem the same

1547
02:05:05,672 --> 02:05:08,008
Original, criminal

1548
02:05:08,509 --> 02:05:10,260
Dressed to kill

1549
02:05:10,344 --> 02:05:13,889
Just call me Cruella de Vil

1550
02:05:15,933 --> 02:05:19,269
Call me crazy, call me insane

1551
02:05:19,353 --> 02:05:21,855
But you're stuck in the past

1552
02:05:21,939 --> 02:05:24,233
And I'm ahead of the game

1553
02:05:25,234 --> 02:05:27,444
A life lived in penance

1554
02:05:27,528 --> 02:05:29,780
It just seems a waste

1555
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:33,534
And the devil has much better taste

1556
02:05:34,034 --> 02:05:36,370
And I tried to be sweet

1557
02:05:36,453 --> 02:05:38,205
I tried to be kind

1558
02:05:38,288 --> 02:05:41,416
But I feel much better now that I'm

1559
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:48,173
Out of my mind

1560
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:55,222
Oh, there always line in the gates of hell

1561
02:05:55,305 --> 02:05:58,058
But I go right to the front gate
'cause I dress this well

1562
02:05:58,141 --> 02:06:00,561
Rip it up, leave it all in tatters

1563
02:06:00,644 --> 02:06:03,438
Beauty is the only thing that matters

1564
02:06:04,857 --> 02:06:10,487
The fabric of your little world is torn

1565
02:06:11,655 --> 02:06:14,533
Embrace the darkness

1566
02:06:14,658 --> 02:06:18,412
Be really blind

1567
02:06:19,288 --> 02:06:21,665
Cruella de Vil

1568
02:06:21,748 --> 02:06:24,084
The fear on your face

1569
02:06:24,168 --> 02:06:26,461
It gives me a thrill

1570
02:06:47,274 --> 02:06:48,859
Hello, Pongo.

1571
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:02,581
Cruella de Vil

1572
02:07:03,248 --> 02:07:06,210
Cruella de Vil

1573
02:07:06,376 --> 02:07:09,338
If she doesn't scare you

1574
02:07:09,505 --> 02:07:12,549
No evil thing will

1575
02:07:12,716 --> 02:07:17,679
To see her is to take a certain chill

1576
02:07:19,181 --> 02:07:23,310
Cruella, Cruella de Vil
